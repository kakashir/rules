New:  KVM: selftests: arm64: Introduce and use
[PATCH v2 1/2] KVM: selftests: arm64: Introduce and use
Author: Raghavendra Rao Ananta <rananta@google.com>

The kvm selftest library for arm64 currently configures the hardware
fields, such as shift and mask in the page-table entries and registers,
directly with numbers. While it add comments at places, it's better to
rewrite them with appropriate macros to improve the readability and
reduce the risk of errors. Hence, introduce macros to define the
hardware fields and use them in the arm64 processor library.

Most of the definitions are primary copied from the Linux's header,
arch/arm64/include/asm/pgtable-hwdef.h.

No functional change intended.

New:  KVM : selftests: arm64: Explicitly set the page attrs
[PATCH v2 0/2] KVM : selftests: arm64: Explicitly set the page attrs
Author: Raghavendra Rao Ananta <rananta@google.com>

The series fixes a conflict in memory attributes in some
implementations,
such as Neoverse-N3, that causes a data abort in guest EL1 with FSC
0x35 (IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED fault (Unsupported Exclusive or Atomic
access)).

Patch-1 is a cleanup patch that replaces numbers (and comments) to
using proper macros for hardware configuration, such as registers and
page-table entries.

Patch-2 fixes the actual bug and sets the page attrs to Inner-Shareable
by default for the VMs created in the selftests. More details are
presented in the commit text.

v1: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250404220659.1312465-1-rananta@google.com/

v1 -> v2: Addressed Oliver's comments (thank you)
 - Moved the TCR_* macros from tools' sysreg.h to selftests' local processor.h
   in patch-1.
 - Adjsted the citations to describe the issue more appropriately in
   patch-2.
