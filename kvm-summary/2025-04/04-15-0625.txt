New:  KVM: selftests: Add function to allow one-to-one GVA
[PATCH v6 01/30] KVM: selftests: Add function to allow one-to-one GVA
Author: Sagi Shahar <sagis@google.com>


One-to-one GVA to GPA mappings can be used in the guest to set up boot
sequences during which paging is enabled, hence requiring a transition
from using physical to virtual addresses in consecutive instructions.

New:  TDX KVM selftests
[PATCH v6 00/30] TDX KVM selftests
Author: Sagi Shahar <sagis@google.com>

This is v6 of the TDX selftests that follow RFC v5 sent more than a year
ago. While it has been a while since the previous posting, the TDX
selftests kept up to date with the latest TDX development and supported
the health of the TDX base series.

With TDX base support now in kvm-coco-queue it is a good opportunity to
to again share the TDX selftests and also remove the "RFC" to convey that
this work is now ready to be considered for inclusion in support of the
TDX base support.

Apart from the addition of one new test ("KVM: selftests: TDX: Test
LOG_DIRTY_PAGES flag to a non-GUEST_MEMFD memslot") this series should be
familiar to anybody that previously looked at "RFC v5". All previous feedback
has been addressed. At the same time the changes to TDX base support needed
several matching changes in the TDX selftests that prompted dropping all
previously received "Reviewed-by" tags to indicate that the patches deserve
a new look. In support of upstream inclusion this version also includes many
non functional changes intended to follow the style and customs of this area.

This series is based on: commit 58dd191cf39c ("KVM: x86: Forbid the use of
kvm_load_host_xsave_state() with guest_state_protected") from branch
kvm-coco-queue on git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/kvm/kvm.git

While the kvm-coco-queue already contains these selftests, this is a
more up-to-date version of the patches.

The tree can be found at:
https://github.com/googleprodkernel/linux-cc/tree/tdx-selftests-v6

I would like to acknowledge the following people, who helped keep these
patches up to date with the latest TDX patches and prepare them for
review:

New:  Revert "PCI: Avoid reset when disabled via sysfs"
[PATCH] Revert "PCI: Avoid reset when disabled via sysfs"
Author: Alex Williamson <alex.williamson@redhat.com>

This reverts commit 479380efe1625e251008d24b2810283db60d6fcd.

The reset_method attribute on a PCI device is only intended to manage
the availability of function scoped resets for a device.  It was never
intended to restrict resets targeting the bus or slot.

In introducing a restriction that each device must support function
level reset by testing pci_reset_supported(), we essentially create a
catch-22, that a device must have a function scope reset in order to
support bus/slot reset, when we use bus/slot reset to effect a reset
of a device that does not support a function scoped reset, especially
multi-function devices.

This breaks the majority of uses cases where vfio-pci uses bus/slot
resets to manage multifunction devices that do not support function
scoped resets.

New:  KVM: selftests: Extract guts of THP accessor to
[PATCH v3 1/5] KVM: selftests: Extract guts of THP accessor to
Author: James Houghton <jthoughton@google.com>


Extract the guts of thp_configured() and get_trans_hugepagesz() to
standalone helpers so that the core logic can be reused for other sysfs
files, e.g. to query numa_balancing.

Opportunistically assert that the initial fscanf() read at least one byte,
and add a comment explaining the second call to fscanf().

New:  KVM: selftests: access_tracking_perf_test fixes for
[PATCH v3 0/5] KVM: selftests: access_tracking_perf_test fixes for
Author: James Houghton <jthoughton@google.com>

This series fixes some issues with access_tracking_perf_test when MGLRU
or NUMA balancing are in use.

With MGLRU, touching a page doesn't necessarily clear the Idle flag.
This has come up in the past, and the recommendation was to use MGLRU
generation numbers[1], which this series does.

With NUMA balancing, pages are temporarily mapped as PROT_NONE, so the
SPTEs will be zapped, losing the Accessed bits. The fix here is, in the
event we have lost access information to print a warning and continue
with the test, just like what we do if the test is running a nested VM.

A flag is added for the user to specify if they wish for the test to
always enforce or always skip this check.

Based on kvm/next.

Changelog:

v2[3] -> v3:
- Applied David's directory fix on patch 3.
- Added SoB-by, R-by (patch 2, missed in v2), and A-by.

v1[2] -> v2:
- Re-add clone3_selftests.h for cgroup selftests (thanks Michal!)
- Some comment fixes, patches 2 and 5 (thanks Maxim!).

New:  KVM: s390: Don't use %pK through tracepoints
[PATCH AUTOSEL 5.4 1/5] KVM: s390: Don't use %pK through tracepoints
Author: Sasha Levin <sashal@kernel.org>


[ Upstream commit 6c9567e0850be2f0f94ab64fa6512413fd1a1eb1 ]

Restricted pointers ("%pK") are not meant to be used through TP_format().
It can unintentionally expose security sensitive, raw pointer values.

Use regular pointer formatting instead.

[PATCH 1/2] KVM: x86: Use asm_inline() instead of asm() in kvm_hypercall[0-4]()
Author: Uros Bizjak <ubizjak@gmail.com>

Use asm_inline() to instruct the compiler that the size of asm()
is the minimum size of one instruction, ignoring how many instructions
the compiler thinks it is. ALTERNATIVE macro that expands to several
pseudo directives causes instruction length estimate to count
more than 20 instructions.

bloat-o-meter reports minimal code size increase
(x86_64 defconfig, gcc-14.2.1):

  add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 1/0 up/down: 10/0 (10)

	Function                          old     new   delta

	__send_ipi_mask                   525     535     +10

  Total: Before=23751224, After=23751234, chg +0.00%

due to different compiler decisions with more precise size
estimations.

No functional change intended.
