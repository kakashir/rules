New:  KVM: arm64: Prevent userspace from disabling AArch64 support at any virtualisable EL
[PATCH 1/2] KVM: arm64: Prevent userspace from disabling AArch64 support at any virtualisable EL
Author: Marc Zyngier <maz@kernel.org>

A sorry excuse for a selftest is trying to disable AArch64 support.
And yes, this goes as well as you can imagine.

Let's forbid this sort of things. Normal userspace shouldn't get
caught doing that.

New:  KVM: arm64: Make AArch64 support sticky
[PATCH 0/2] KVM: arm64: Make AArch64 support sticky
Author: Marc Zyngier <maz@kernel.org>

It's been recently reported[1] that our sorry excuse for a test suite
is writing a bunch of zeroes to ID_AA64PFR0_EL1.EL{0,1,2,3},
effectively removing the advertised support for AArch64 to the guest.

This leads to an interesting interaction with the NV code which reacts
in a slightly overzealous way and inject an UNDEF at the earliest
opportunity.

This small series fixes KVM by bluntly refusing to disable AArch64,
and the test to stop being so lame. I'm also fixing the NV code
separately, since it isn't upstream.

New:  context_tracking,x86: Defer some IPIs until a user->kernel transition
[PATCH v5 00/25] context_tracking,x86: Defer some IPIs until a user->kernel transition
Author: Valentin Schneider <vschneid@redhat.com>

Context
=======

We've observed within Red Hat that isolated, NOHZ_FULL CPUs running a
pure-userspace application get regularly interrupted by IPIs sent from
housekeeping CPUs. Those IPIs are caused by activity on the housekeeping CPUs
leading to various on_each_cpu() calls, e.g.:

  64359.052209596    NetworkManager       0    1405     smp_call_function_many_cond (cpu=0, func=do_kernel_range_flush)
    smp_call_function_many_cond+0x1
    smp_call_function+0x39
    on_each_cpu+0x2a
    flush_tlb_kernel_range+0x7b
    __purge_vmap_area_lazy+0x70
    _vm_unmap_aliases.part.42+0xdf
    change_page_attr_set_clr+0x16a
    set_memory_ro+0x26
    bpf_int_jit_compile+0x2f9
    bpf_prog_select_runtime+0xc6
    bpf_prepare_filter+0x523
    sk_attach_filter+0x13
    sock_setsockopt+0x92c
    __sys_setsockopt+0x16a
    __x64_sys_setsockopt+0x20
    do_syscall_64+0x87
    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x65

The heart of this series is the thought that while we cannot remove NOHZ_FULL
CPUs from the list of CPUs targeted by these IPIs, they may not have to execute
the callbacks immediately. Anything that only affects kernelspace can wait
until the next user->kernel transition, providing it can be executed "early
enough" in the entry code.

The original implementation is from Peter [1]. Nicolas then added kernel TLB
invalidation deferral to that [2], and I picked it up from there.

Deferral approach
=================

Storing each and every callback, like a secondary call_single_queue turned out
to be a no-go: the whole point of deferral is to keep NOHZ_FULL CPUs in
userspace for as long as possible - no signal of any form would be sent when
deferring an IPI. This means that any form of queuing for deferred callbacks
would end up as a convoluted memory leak.

Deferred IPIs must thus be coalesced, which this series achieves by assigning
IPIs a "type" and having a mapping of IPI type to callback, leveraged upon
kernel entry.

What about IPIs whose callback take a parameter, you may ask?

Peter suggested during OSPM23 [3] that since on_each_cpu() targets
housekeeping CPUs *and* isolated CPUs, isolated CPUs can access either global or
housekeeping-CPU-local state to "reconstruct" the data that would have been sent
via the IPI.

This series does not affect any IPI callback that requires an argument, but the
approach would remain the same (one coalescable callback executed on kernel
entry).

Kernel entry vs execution of the deferred operation
===================================================

This is what I've referred to as the "Danger Zone" during my LPC24 talk [4].

There is a non-zero length of code that is executed upon kernel entry before the
deferred operation can be itself executed (before we start getting into
context_tracking.c proper), i.e.:

  idtentry_func_foo()                <--- we're in the kernel
    irqentry_enter()
      enter_from_user_mode()
	__ct_user_exit()
	    ct_kernel_enter_state()
	      ct_work_flush()        <--- deferred operation is executed here

This means one must take extra care to what can happen in the early entry code,
and that <bad things> cannot happen. For instance, we really don't want to hit
instructions that have been modified by a remote text_poke() while we're on our
way to execute a deferred sync_core(). Patches doing the actual deferral have
more detail on this.

Where are we at with this whole thing?
======================================

Dave has been incredibly helpful wrt figuring out what would and wouldn't
(mostly that) be safe to do for deferring kernel range TLB flush IPIs, see [5].

Long story short, there are ugly things I can still do to (safely) defer the TLB
flush IPIs, but it's going to be a long session of pulling my own hair out, and
I got plenty so I won't be done for a while.

In the meantime, I think everything leading up to deferring text poke IPIs is
sane-ish and could get in. I'm not the biggest fan of adding an API with a
single user, but hey, I've been working on this for "a little while" now and
I'll still need to get the other IPIs sorted out.

TL;DR: Text patching IPI deferral LGTM so here it is for now, I'm still working
on the TLB flush thing.

Patches
=======

o Patches 1-2 are standalone objtool cleanups.

o Patches 3-4 add an RCU testing feature.

o Patches 5-6 add infrastructure for annotating static keys and static calls
  that may be used in noinstr code (courtesy of Josh).
o Patches 7-20 use said annotations on relevant keys / calls.
o Patch 21 enforces proper usage of said annotations (courtesy of Josh).

o Patches 22-23 deal with detecting NOINSTR text in modules

o Patches 24-25 add the actual IPI deferral faff

Patches are also available at:
https://gitlab.com/vschneid/linux.git -b redhat/isolirq/defer/v5

Testing
=======

Xeon E5-2699 system with SMToff, NOHZ_FULL, isolated CPUs.
RHEL10 userspace.

Workload is using rteval (kernel compilation + hackbench) on housekeeping CPUs
and a dummy stay-in-userspace loop on the isolated CPUs. The main invocation is:

$ trace-cmd record -e "csd_queue_cpu" -f "cpu & CPUS{$ISOL_CPUS}" \
 	           -e "ipi_send_cpumask" -f "cpumask & CPUS{$ISOL_CPUS}" \
	           -e "ipi_send_cpu"     -f "cpu & CPUS{$ISOL_CPUS}" \
		   rteval --onlyload --loads-cpulist=$HK_CPUS \
		   --hackbench-runlowmem=True --duration=$DURATION

This only records IPIs sent to isolated CPUs, so any event there is interference
(with a bit of fuzz at the start/end of the workload when spawning the
processes). All tests were done with a duration of 3 hours.

v6.14
# This is the actual IPI count
$ trace-cmd report | grep callback | awk '{ print $(NF) }' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
     93 callback=generic_smp_call_function_single_interrupt+0x0
     22 callback=nohz_full_kick_func+0x0
     
# These are the different CSD's that caused IPIs    
$ trace-cmd report | grep csd_queue | awk '{ print $(NF-1) }' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
   1456 func=do_flush_tlb_all
     78 func=do_sync_core
     33 func=nohz_full_kick_func
     26 func=do_kernel_range_flush

v6.14 + patches
# This is the actual IPI count
$ trace-cmd report | grep callback | awk '{ print $(NF) }' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
     86 callback=generic_smp_call_function_single_interrupt+0x0
     41 callback=nohz_full_kick_func+0x0

# These are the different CSD's that caused IPIs          
$ trace-cmd report | grep csd_queue | awk '{ print $(NF-1) }' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
   1378 func=do_flush_tlb_all
     33 func=nohz_full_kick_func

So the TLB flush is still there driving most of the IPIs, but at least the
instruction patching IPIs are gone. With kernel TLB flushes deferred, there are
no IPIs sent to isolated CPUs in that 3hr window, but as stated above that still
needs some more work.
     
Also note that tlb_remove_table_smp_sync() showed up during testing of v3, and
has gone as mysteriously as it showed up. Yair had a series adressing this [6]
which per these results would be worth revisiting.

New:  AMD: Add Secure AVIC Guest Support
[PATCH v5 00/20] AMD: Add Secure AVIC Guest Support
Author: Neeraj Upadhyay <Neeraj.Upadhyay@amd.com>

Introduction
------------

Secure AVIC is a new hardware feature in the AMD64 architecture to
allow SEV-SNP guests to prevent the hypervisor from generating
unexpected interrupts to a vCPU or otherwise violate architectural
assumptions around APIC behavior.

One of the significant differences from AVIC or emulated x2APIC is that
Secure AVIC uses a guest-owned and managed APIC backing page. It also
introduces additional fields in both the VMCB and the Secure AVIC backing
page to aid the guest in limiting which interrupt vectors can be injected
into the guest.

Guest APIC Backing Page
-----------------------
Each vCPU has a guest-allocated APIC backing page of size 4K, which
maintains APIC state for that vCPU. The x2APIC MSRs are mapped at
their corresposing x2APIC MMIO offset within the guest APIC backing
page. All x2APIC accesses by guest or Secure AVIC hardware operate
on this backing page. The backing page should be pinned and NPT entry
for it should be always mapped while the corresponding vCPU is running.


MSR Accesses
------------
Secure AVIC only supports x2APIC MSR accesses. xAPIC MMIO offset based
accesses are not supported.

Some of the MSR accesses such as ICR writes (with shorthand equal to
self), SELF_IPI, EOI, TPR writes are accelerated by Secure AVIC
hardware. Other MSR accesses generate a #VC exception. The #VC
exception handler reads/writes to the guest APIC backing page.
As guest APIC backing page is accessible to the guest, the Secure
AVIC driver code optimizes APIC register access by directly
reading/writing to the guest APIC backing page (instead of taking
the #VC exception route).

In addition to the architected MSRs, following new fields are added to
the guest APIC backing page which can be modified directly by the
guest:

a. ALLOWED_IRR

ALLOWED_IRR reg offset indicates the interrupt vectors which the guest
allows the hypervisor to send. The combination of host-controlled
REQUESTED_IRR vectors (part of VMCB) and ALLOWED_IRR is used by
hardware to update the IRR vectors of the Guest APIC backing page.

#Offset        #bits        Description
204h           31:0         Guest allowed vectors 0-31
214h           31:0         Guest allowed vectors 32-63
...
274h           31:0         Guest allowed vectors 224-255

ALLOWED_IRR is meant to be used specifically for vectors that the
hypervisor is allowed to inject, such as device interrupts.  Interrupt
vectors used exclusively by the guest itself (like IPI vectors) should
not be allowed to be injected into the guest for security reasons.

b. NMI Request
 
#Offset        #bits        Description
278h           0            Set by Guest to request Virtual NMI

Guest need to set NMI Request register to allow the Hypervisor to
inject vNMI to it.

LAPIC Timer Support
-------------------
LAPIC timer is emulated by the hypervisor. So, APIC_LVTT, APIC_TMICT and
APIC_TDCR, APIC_TMCCT APIC registers are not read/written to the guest
APIC backing page and are communicated to the hypervisor using SVM_EXIT_MSR
VMGEXIT. 

IPI Support
-----------
Only SELF_IPI is accelerated by Secure AVIC hardware. Other IPIs require
writing (from the Secure AVIC driver) to the IRR vector of the target CPU
backing page and then issuing VMGEXIT for the hypervisor to notify the
target vCPU.

KEXEC Support
-------------
Secure AVIC enabled guest can kexec to another kernel which has Secure
AVIC enabled, as the Hypervisor has Secure AVIC feature bit set in the
sev_status.

Open Points
-----------

The Secure AVIC driver only supports physical destination mode. If
logical destination mode need to be supported, then a separate x2apic
driver would be required for supporting logical destination mode.


Testing
-------

This series is based on top of commit b12498a42ec7 "Merge branch into
tip/master: 'x86/sev'" of tip/tip master branch.

Host Secure AVIC support patch series is at [1].

Qemu support patch is at [2].

QEMU commandline for testing Secure AVIC enabled guest:

qemu-system-x86_64 <...> -object sev-snp-guest,id=sev0,policy=0xb0000,cbitpos=51,
reduced-phys-bits=1,allowed-sev-features=true,secure-avic=true

Following tests are done:

1) Boot to Prompt using initramfs and ubuntu fs.
2) Verified timer and IPI as part of the guest bootup.

  - Add separate patch for update_vector() apic callback addition.
  - Add a cleanup patch for moving apic_update_irq_cfg() calls to
    apic_update_vector().
  - Cleaned up change logs.
  - Rebased to latest tip/tip master. Resolved merge conflicts due to
    sev code movement to sev-startup.c in mainline.
  - Other misc cleanups.

Change since v3

v3: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250401113616.204203-1-Neeraj.Upadhyay@amd.com/

  - Added Kexec support.
  - Instead of doing a 2M aligned allocation for backing pages,
    allocate individual PAGE_SIZE pages for vCPUs.
  - Instead of reading Extended Topology Enumeration CPUID, APIC_ID
    value is read from Hv and updated in APIC backing page. Hv returned
    ID is checked for any duplicates.

New:  kernel-hacking: introduce CONFIG_NO_AUTO_INLINE
[PATCH RFC v3 0/8] kernel-hacking: introduce CONFIG_NO_AUTO_INLINE
Author: Chen Linxuan via B4 Relay <devnull+chenlinxuan.uniontech.com@kernel.org>

This series introduces a new kernel configuration option NO_AUTO_INLINE,
which can be used to disable the automatic inlining of functions.

This will allow the function tracer to trace more functions
because it only traces functions that the compiler has not inlined.

Add a type enum to the net_iov which tells us the net_iov type.

  NET_IOV_UNSPECIFIED.
- Post send binding to net_devmem_dmabuf_bindings after it's been fully
  initialized (Stan).

===

Changelog:
- Check the dmabuf net_iov binding belongs to the device the TX is going

v6: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20250222191517.743530-1-almasrymina@google.com/
===

v6 has no major changes. Addressed a few issues from Paolo and David,
and collected Acks from Stan. Thank you everyone for the review!

Changes:
- retain behavior to process MSG_FASTOPEN even if the provided cmsg is
  invalid (Paolo).
- Rework the freeing of tx_vec slightly (it now has its own err label).
  (Paolo).
- Squash the commit that makes dmabuf unbinding scheduled work into the
  same one which implements the TX path so we don't run into future
  errors on bisecting (Paolo).
- Fix/add comments to explain how dmabuf binding refcounting works
  (David).

v5: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20250220020914.895431-1-almasrymina@google.com/
===

v5 has no major changes; it clears up the relatively minor issues
pointed out to in v4, and rebases the series on top of net-next to
resolve the conflict with a patch that raced to the tree. It also
collects the review tags from v4.

Changes:
- Rebase to net-next
- Fix issues in selftest (Stan).
- Address comments in the devmem and netmem driver docs (Stan and Bagas)
- Fix zerocopy_fill_skb_from_devmem return error code (Stan).

v4: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20250203223916.1064540-1-almasrymina@google.com/
===

v4 mainly addresses the critical driver support issue surfaced in v3 by
Paolo and Stan. Drivers aiming to support netmem_tx should make sure not
to pass the netmem dma-addrs to the dma-mapping APIs, as these dma-addrs
may come from dma-bufs.

Additionally other feedback from v3 is addressed.

Major changes:
- Add helpers to handle netmem dma-addrs. Add GVE support for
  netmem_tx.
- Fix binding->tx_vec not being freed on error paths during the
  tx binding.
- Add a minimal devmem_tx test to devmem.py.
- Clean up everything obsolete from the cover letter (Paolo).

v3: https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/netdevbpf/list/?series=929401&state=*
===

Address minor comments from RFCv2 and fix a few build warnings and
ynl-regen issues. No major changes.

RFC v2: https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/netdevbpf/list/?series=920056&state=*
=======

RFC v2 addresses much of the feedback from RFC v1. I plan on sending
something close to this as net-next  reopens, sending it slightly early
to get feedback if any.

Major changes:
--------------

- much improved UAPI as suggested by Stan. We now interpret the iov_base
  of the passed in iov from userspace as the offset into the dmabuf to
  send from. This removes the need to set iov.iov_base = NULL which may
  be confusing to users, and enables us to send multiple iovs in the
  same sendmsg() call. ncdevmem and the docs show a sample use of that.

- Removed the duplicate dmabuf iov_iter in binding->iov_iter. I think
  this is good improvment as it was confusing to keep track of
  2 iterators for the same sendmsg, and mistracking both iterators
  caused a couple of bugs reported in the last iteration that are now
  resolved with this streamlining.

- Improved test coverage in ncdevmem. Now multiple sendmsg() are tested,
  and sending multiple iovs in the same sendmsg() is tested.

- Fixed issue where dmabuf unmapping was happening in invalid context
  (Stan).

====================================================================

The TX path had been dropped from the Device Memory TCP patch series
post RFCv1 [1], to make that series slightly easier to review. This
series rebases the implementation of the TX path on top of the
net_iov/netmem framework agreed upon and merged. The motivation for
the feature is thoroughly described in the docs & cover letter of the
original proposal, so I don't repeat the lengthy descriptions here, but
they are available in [1].

Full outline on usage of the TX path is detailed in the documentation
included with this series.

Test example is available via the kselftest included in the series as well.

The series is relatively small, as the TX path for this feature largely
piggybacks on the existing MSG_ZEROCOPY implementation.

Patch Overview:
---------------

1. Documentation & tests to give high level overview of the feature
   being added.

1. Add netmem refcounting needed for the TX path.

2. Devmem TX netlink API.

3. Devmem TX net stack implementation.

4. Make dma-buf unbinding scheduled work to handle TX cases where it gets
   freed from contexts where we can't sleep.

5. Add devmem TX documentation.

6. Add scaffolding enabling driver support for netmem_tx. Add helpers, driver
feature flag, and docs to enable drivers to declare netmem_tx support.

7. Guard netmem_tx against being enabled against drivers that don't
   support it.

8. Add devmem_tx selftests. Add TX path to ncdevmem and add a test to
   devmem.py.

Testing:
--------

Testing is very similar to devmem TCP RX path. The ncdevmem test used
for the RX path is now augemented with client functionality to test TX
path.

* Test Setup:

Kernel: net-next with this RFC and memory provider API cherry-picked
locally.

Hardware: Google Cloud A3 VMs.

NIC: GVE with header split & RSS & flow steering support.

Performance results are not included with this version, unfortunately.
I'm having issues running the dma-buf exporter driver against the
upstream kernel on my test setup. The issues are specific to that
dma-buf exporter and do not affect this patch series. I plan to follow
up this series with perf fixes if the tests point to issues once they're
up and running.

Special thanks to Stan who took a stab at rebasing the TX implementation
on top of the netmem/net_iov framework merged. Parts of his proposal [2]
that are reused as-is are forked off into their own patches to give full
credit.
