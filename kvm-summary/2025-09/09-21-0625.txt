New:  genirq/msi: Provide DOMAIN_BUS_MSI_REMAP
[RFC PATCH v2 01/18] genirq/msi: Provide DOMAIN_BUS_MSI_REMAP
Author: Andrew Jones <ajones@ventanamicro.com>

Provide a domain bus token for the upcoming support for the RISC-V
IOMMU interrupt remapping domain, which needs to be distinguished
from NEXUS domains. The new token name is generic, as the only
information that needs to be conveyed is that the IRQ domain will
remap MSIs, i.e. there's nothing RISC-V specific to convey.

Since the MSI_REMAP domain implements init_dev_msi_info() with
msi_parent_init_dev_msi_info(), which makes 'domain' point to
the NEXUS domain, while keeping 'msi_parent_domain' pointing to
itself, there's nothing to do in msi-lib to add support except
to accept the token.

New:  iommu/riscv: Add irqbypass support
[RFC PATCH v2 00/18] iommu/riscv: Add irqbypass support
Author: Andrew Jones <ajones@ventanamicro.com>

Changelog
---------
This is v2 of the RFC for adding interrupt remapping support to the
RISC-V IOMMU driver along with support for KVM in order to apply it
to irqbypass. v1 of the series was discussed here[1] where a couple
large design flaws were pointed out. Those, along with a v1 TODO of
referencing counting MSI PTEs in order to track when they may be
unmapped, have been addressed in v2. Additionally, v2 is based on
msi-lib, which didn't exist at the time of the v1 posting, and on
the recent KVM irqbypass rework.

Description
-----------
Platforms with MSI support (IMSICs) and implementations of the RISC-V
IOMMU with an MSI table can control device MSI delivery, including
directly delivering MSIs of devices assigned to guests to VCPUs. This
series enables that control and enables IOMMU_DMA in order to use
paging IOMMU domains by default. When the IOMMU doesn't support an MSI
table (it's an optional IOMMU capability) then paging domains are still
used, but the system does not have isolated MSIs. For direct delivery
to VCPUs an MSI table is required and thanks to KVM+VFIO it's possible
to determine when and how to map guest IMSIC addresses to host guest
interrupt files. The RISC-V IOMMU and AIA also support MRIFs (memory-
resident interrupt files), but support for those will be posted as a
follow-on to this series. Also, additional work will be done in order
to take advantage of the RISC-V IOMMU's second stage of paging. At
this time, the series just uses the first stage which allows testing
with unmodified KVM userspace and VFIO.

The patches are organized as follows:
  1-4:  Create an irq domain and some function stubs for an initial
        interrupt remapping support skeleton
  5-9:  Add MSI table management to enable host interrupt remapping
        and enable IOMMU_DMA
 10-13: Add IOMMU driver support for directly delivering MSIs to VCPUs
 14-17: Add KVM support for directly delivering MSIs to VCPUs

The last patch is a workaround for a KVM bug not introduced by this series
which is needed to enable testing of the series -- I still need to debug
and fix that properly.

There series is also available here[2].

Based on commit 39879e3a4106.

New:  KVM: arm64: selftests: Remove a duplicate register
[PATCH 1/2] KVM: arm64: selftests: Remove a duplicate register
Author: Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>

Currently we list the main set of registers with bits we test three
times, once in the test_regs array which is used at runtime, once in the
guest code and once in a list of ARRAY_SIZE() operations we use to tell
kselftest how many tests we plan to execute. This is needlessly fiddly,
when adding new registers as the test_cnt calculation is formatted with
two registers per line. Instead count the number of bitfields in the
register arrays at runtime.

The existing code subtracts ARRAY_SIZE(test_regs) from the number of
tests to account for the terminating FTR_REG_END entries in the per
register arrays, the new code accounts for this when enumerating.

[PATCH 0/2] KVM: arm64: selftests: Cover ID_AA64ISAR3_EL1 in
Author: Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>

The set_id_regs selftest lacks coverag for ID_AA64ISR3_EL1 which has
several features exposed to KVM guests in it.  Add coverage, and while
we're here adjust the test to improve maintainability a bit.  

The test will fail without the recently applied change adding FEAT_LSFE:

New:  KVM: SEV: Rename kvm_ghcb_get_sw_exit_code() to kvm_get_cached_sw_exit_code()
[PATCH v16 01/51] KVM: SEV: Rename kvm_ghcb_get_sw_exit_code() to kvm_get_cached_sw_exit_code()
Author: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

Rename kvm_ghcb_get_sw_exit_code() to kvm_get_cached_sw_exit_code() to make
it clear that KVM is getting the cached value, not reading directly from
the guest-controlled GHCB.  More importantly, vacating
kvm_ghcb_get_sw_exit_code() will allow adding a KVM-specific macro-built
kvm_ghcb_get_##field() helper to read values from the GHCB.

No functional change intended.

New:  KVM: x86: Super Mega CET
[PATCH v16 00/51] KVM: x86: Super Mega CET
Author: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

As the subject suggests, this series continues to grow, as there an absolutely
stupid number of edge cases and interactions.

There are (a lot) more changes between v15 and v16 than I was hoping for, but
there all fairly "minor" in the sense that it's things like disabling SHSTK
when using the shadow MMU.  I.e. it's mostly "configuration" fixes, and very
few logical changes (outside of msrs_test.c, which has non-trivial changes due
to ignore_msrs, argh).

So, my plan is to still land this in 6.18.  I'm going to push it to -next
today to get as much testing as possible, but in a dedicated branch so that I
can fixup as needed (e.g. even if it's just for reviews).  I'll freeze the
hashes sometime next week.

I probably missed some of the changes in the log below, sorry.

P.S. I have a pile of local changes to the CET KVM-Unit-Test, I'll post them
     sometime next week.

v16:
 - Collect more reviews.
 - Reject task switch emulation if IBT or SHSTK. [Binbin]
 - Improve various comments and fix typos. [Binbin]
 - Accept writes to XSS for SEV-ES guests even though that state is
   "protected", as KVM needs to update its internal tracking in response to
   guest changes. [John]
 - Drop @ghcb from KVM's accessors so that it's harder to screw up. [Tom]
 - s/KVM_X86_REG_ENCODE/KVM_X86_REG_ID. [Binbin]
 - Append "cc" to cpu_has_vmx_basic_no_hw_errcode(). [Binbin]
 - Use "KVM: SVM" for shortlogs. [Xin]
 - Disable SHSTK if TDP is disabled (affects AMD only because Intel was already
   disabling support indirectly thanks to Unrestricted Guest).
 - Disable IBT and SHSTK of allow_smaller_maxphyaddr is true (Intel only
   because it doesn't work on AMD with NPT).
 - Rework IBT instruction detection to realy on IsBranch and the operand source
   instead of having to manually inspect+tag each instruction.
 - Handle the annoying #GP case for SSP[63:32] != 0 when transitioning to
   compatibility mode so that FAR JMP doesn't need to be disallowed when
   SHSTK is enabled (I don't anyone would care, but special casing FAR JMP for
   a very solvable problem felt lazy).
 - Add a define for PFERR_SS_MASK and pretty print the missing PFERR (don't ask
   me how long it took to figure out why the SHSTK KUT testcase failed when
   I tried to run it with npt=0).
 - Advertise LOAD_CET_STATE fields for nVMX iff one of IBT or SHSTK is
   supported (being able to load non-existent CET state is all kinds of weird).
 - Explicitly check for SHSTK when translating MSR_KVM_INTERNAL_GUEST_SSP to
   avoid running afoul of ignore_msrs.
 - Add TSC_AUX to the 
 - Skip negative tests in msrs_tests when ignore_msrs is true (KVM's ABI, or
   rather lack thereof, is truly awful).
 - Remove an unnecessary round of vcpu_run() calls. [Chao]
 - Use ex_str() in a few more tests. [Chao]
 - Add XFEATURE_MASK_CET_ALL to simplify referencing KERNEL and USER, which
   KVM always does as a pair. [Binbin]

v15:
 - https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250912232319.429659-1-seanjc@google.com
 - Collect reviews (hopefully I got 'em all).
 - Add support for KVM_GET_REG_LIST.
 - Load FPU when accessing XSTATE MSRs via ONE_REG ioctls.
 - Explicitly return -EINVAL on kvm_set_one_msr() failure.
 - Make is_xstate_managed_msr() more precise (check guest caps).
 - Dedup guts of kvm_{g,s}et_xstate_msr() (as kvm_access_xstate_msr()).
 - WARN if KVM uses kvm_access_xstate_msr() to access an MSR that isn't
   managed via XSAVE.
 - Document why S_CET isn't treated as an XSTATE-managed MSR.
 - Mark VMCB_CET as clean/dirty as appropriate.
 - Add nSVM support for the CET VMCB fields.
 - Add an "msrs" selftest to coverage ONE_REG and host vs. guest accesses in
   general.
 - Add patches to READ_ONCE() guest-writable GHCB fields, and to check the
   validity of XCR0 "writes".
 - Check the validity of XSS "writes" via common MSR emulation.
 - Add {CP,HV,VC,SV}_VECTOR definitions so that tracing and selftests can
   pretty print them.
 - Add pretty printing for unexpected exceptions in selftests.
 - Tweak the emulator rejection to be more precise (grab S_CET vs. U_CET based
   CPL for near transfers), and to avoid unnecessary reads of CR4, S_CET, and
   U_CET.
