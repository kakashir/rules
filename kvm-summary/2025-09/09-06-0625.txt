New:  x86,fs/resctrl: Consolidate monitor event descriptions
[PATCH v18 01/33] x86,fs/resctrl: Consolidate monitor event descriptions
Author: Babu Moger <babu.moger@amd.com>


There are currently only three monitor events, all associated with
the RDT_RESOURCE_L3 resource. Growing support for additional events
will be easier with some restructuring to have a single point in
file system code where all attributes of all events are defined.

Place all event descriptions into an array mon_event_all[]. Doing
this has the beneficial side effect of removing the need for
rdt_resource::evt_list.

Add resctrl_event_id::QOS_FIRST_EVENT for a lower bound on range
checks for event ids and as the starting index to scan mon_event_all[].

Drop the code that builds evt_list and change the two places where
the list is scanned to scan mon_event_all[] instead using a new
helper macro for_each_mon_event().

Architecture code now informs file system code which events are
available with resctrl_enable_mon_event().

New:  x86,fs/resctrl: Support AMD Assignable Bandwidth Monitoring Counters (ABMC)
[PATCH v18 00/33] x86,fs/resctrl: Support AMD Assignable Bandwidth Monitoring Counters (ABMC)
Author: Babu Moger <babu.moger@amd.com>


This series adds the support for Assignable Bandwidth Monitoring Counters
(ABMC). It is also called QoS RMID Pinning feature.

Series is written such that it is easier to support other assignable
features supported from different vendors.

The feature details are documented in APM [1] available from [2].
[1] AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual Volume 2: System Programming
Publication # 24593 Revision 3.41 section 19.3.3.3 Assignable Bandwidth
Monitoring (ABMC). The documentation is available at
Link: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206537 # [2]

The patches are based on top of commit (6.17.0-rc4)
commit 7005ad1c5fa6 ("Merge branch into tip/master: 'x86/tdx'")

Comments and suggestions are welcome, as ever.

# Introduction

Users can create as many monitor groups as RMIDs supported by the hardware.
However, the bandwidth monitoring feature on AMD systems only guarantees
that RMIDs currently assigned to a processor will be tracked by hardware.
The counters of any other RMIDs which are no longer being tracked will be
reset to zero. The MBM event counters return "Unavailable" for the RMIDs
that are not tracked by hardware. So, there can be only limited number of
groups that can give guaranteed monitoring numbers. With ever changing
configurations there is no way to definitely know which of these groups
are being tracked during a particular time. Users do not have the option
to monitor a group or set of groups for a certain period of time without
worrying about counters being reset in between.
    
The ABMC feature allows users to assign a hardware counter ID to an RMID,
event pair and monitor bandwidth usage as long as it is assigned. The
hardware continues to track the assigned counter until it is explicitly
unassigned by the user. Additionally, the user can specify the type of
memory transactions (e.g., reads, writes) to be tracked by the counter
for the assigned RMID.

Without ABMC enabled, monitoring will work in current 'default' mode without
assignment option.

# History

Earlier implementation of ABMC had dependancy on BMEC (Bandwidth Monitoring
Event Configuration). Peter had concerns with that implementation because
it may be not be compatible with ARM's MPAM.

Here are the threads discussing the concerns and new interface to address the concerns.
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CALPaoCg97cLVVAcacnarp+880xjsedEWGJPXhYpy4P7=ky4MZw@mail.gmail.com/
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CALPaoCiii0vXOF06mfV=kVLBzhfNo0SFqt4kQGwGSGVUqvr2Dg@mail.gmail.com/

Here are the finalized requirements based on the discussion:

*   BMEC and ABMC are incompatible with each other. They need to be mutually exclusive.

*   Eliminate global assignment listing. The interface
    /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign_control is no longer required.

*   Create the configuration directories at /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/event_configs/.
    The configuration file names should be free-form, allowing users to create them as needed.

*   Perform assignment listing at the group level by introducing mbm_L3_assignments
    in each monitoring group level. The listing should provide the following details:

    Event Configuration: Specifies the event configuration applied. This will be crucial
    when "mkdir" on event configuration is added in the future, leading to the creation
    of mon_data/mon_l3_*/<event configuration>.

    Domains: Identifies the domains where the configuration is applied, supporting multi-domain setups.

    Assignment Type: Indicates whether the assignment is Exclusive (e or d), Shared (s), or Unassigned (_).

    Exclusive assignment: Assign the counter ID the RMID, event pair exclusively.
    
    Shared assignment: A shared assignment applies to both soft-ABMC and ABMC. A user can designate a
                       "counter" (could be hardware counter or "active" RMID) as shared and that means
                       the counter within that domain is shared between different monitor groups and actual
                       assignment is scheduled by resctrl.  

    Unassigned: No longer assigned.

*   Provide option to enable or disable auto assignment when new group is created.

*   Keep the flexibility to support future assign options like Soft-ABMC etc.
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/7f10fa69-d1fe-4748-b10c-fa0c9b60bd66@intel.com/
    

This series addresses the requirements listed above and keeping the options open for future
enhancements.

# Implementation details

Create a generic interface to support user space assignment of scarce
counters used for monitoring. First usage of interface is by ABMC with option
to expand usage to "soft-ABMC" and MPAM counters in future.

Feature adds following interface files:

/sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign_mode: Reports the list of assignable
monitoring features supported. The enclosed brackets indicate which
feature is enabled.

/sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/num_mbm_cntrs: The maximum number of monitoring counters
(total of available and assigned counters) in each domain when the system supports
mbm_event mode.

/sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/available_mbm_cntrs: The number of monitoring counters
available for assignment in each domain when mbm_event mode is enabled on the system.

/sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/event_configs: Contains sub-directory for each MBM event
					   that can be assigned to a counter.

/sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/event_configs/mbm_total_bytes/event_filter: The type of
			memory transactions tracked by the event mbm_total_bytes.

/sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/event_configs/mbm_local_bytes/event_filter: The type of
			memory transactions tracked by the event mbm_local_bytes.

/sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignments: Per monitor group interface to list or modify
				    counters assigned to the group.

/sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign_on_mkdir: Interface to enable automatic assignments
						 on resctrl group creation.
# Examples

a. Check if MBM assign support is available
	#mount -t resctrl resctrl /sys/fs/resctrl/

	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign_mode
	[mbm_event]
	default

	mbm_event feature is detected and it is enabled.

b. Check how many assignable counters are supported. 

	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/num_mbm_cntrs 
	0=32;1=32

c. Check how many assignable counters are available for assignment in each domain.

	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/available_mbm_cntrs 
	0=30;1=30

d. Check the default event configuration.

	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/event_configs/mbm_total_bytes/event_filter 
	local_reads,remote_reads,local_non_temporal_writes,remote_non_temporal_writes,
        local_reads_slow_memory,remote_reads_slow_memory,dirty_victim_writes_all

	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/event_configs/mbm_local_bytes/event_filter 
	local_reads,local_non_temporal_writes,local_reads_slow_memory

e. Series adds a new interface file "mbm_L3_assignments" in each monitoring group
   to list and modify that group's monitoring states.

	The list is displayed in the following format:

	<Event>:<Domain id>=<Assignment state>;<Domain id>=<Assignment state>

        Event: A valid MBM event listed in the
        /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/event_configs directory.

        Domain ID: A valid domain ID.

        Assignment types:

        _ : No counter assigned.

        e : Counter assigned exclusively.

	To list the default group states:
	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignments
	mbm_total_bytes:0=e;1=e
	mbm_local_bytes:0=e;1=e

	To unassign the counter associated with the mbm_total_bytes event on domain 0:
	# echo "mbm_total_bytes:0=_" > /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignments
	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignments
	mbm_total_bytes:0=_;1=e
	mbm_local_bytes:0=e;1=e

	To unassign the counter associated with the mbm_total_bytes event on all domains:
    	# echo "mbm_total_bytes:*=_" > /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignments
	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignment
	mbm_total_bytes:0=_;1=_
	mbm_local_bytes:0=e;1=e

	To assign a counter associated with the mbm_total_bytes event on all domains in exclusive mode:
    	# echo "mbm_total_bytes:*=e" > /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignments
	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignments
	mbm_total_bytes:0=e;1=e
	mbm_local_bytes:0=e;1=e

g. Read the events mbm_total_bytes and mbm_local_bytes of the default group.
   There is no change in reading the events with the assignment.  If the event is unassigned
   when reading, then the read will come back as "Unassigned".
	
	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/mon_L3_00/mbm_total_bytes
	779247936
	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/mon_L3_01/mbm_total_bytes
	10101346
	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/mon_L3_00/mbm_local_bytes 
	765207488
	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/mon_L3_01/mbm_local_bytes 
	12125777
	
h. Check the event configurations.

	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/event_configs/mbm_total_bytes/event_filter
	local_reads,remote_reads,local_non_temporal_writes,remote_non_temporal_writes,
	local_reads_slow_memory,remote_reads_slow_memory,dirty_victim_writes_all

	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/event_configs/mbm_local_bytes/event_filter
	local_reads,local_non_temporal_writes,local_reads_slow_memory

i. Change the event configuration for mbm_local_bytes.

	# echo "local_reads, local_non_temporal_writes, local_reads_slow_memory, remote_reads" >
	/sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/event_configs/mbm_local_bytes/event_filter

	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/event_configs/mbm_local_bytes/event_filter
	local_reads,local_non_temporal_writes,local_reads_slow_memory,remote_reads
	
j. Now read the local event again. The first read may come back with "Unavailable"
   status. The subsequent read of mbm_local_bytes will display the current value.
	
	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/mon_L3_00/mbm_local_bytes
	Unavailable
	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/mon_L3_00/mbm_local_bytes
	314101
	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/mon_L3_01/mbm_local_bytes
        42322

k. Users have the option to go back to 'default' mbm_assign_mode if required.
   This can be done using the following command. Note that switching the
   mbm_assign_mode will reset all the MBM counters (and thus all MBM events) of all
   the resctrl groups.

	# echo "default" > /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign_mode
	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign_mode
	mbm_event
	[default]
	
l. Unmount the resctrl filesystem.
	 
	# umount /sys/fs/resctrl/

   Added example section in user doc (resctrl.rst) on how to use mbm_assign_modes.

v13:
   Removed BMEC related 2 patches which were in the previous series.
   It was related to optimization which can be doen later.

   Patches are created on top of FS/ARCH restructure. So, major changes
   are due to FS/ARCH restructure. The files are split between
   arch/x86/kernel/cpu/resctrl/ and fs/resctrl/. So, functions
   are moved between these files accordingly.

   Added fflag RFTYPE_RES_CACHE for mbm_assign_mode, num_mbm_cntrs, available_mbm_cntrs.

   Removed the references to "mbm_assign_control".
  
   Moved resctrl_arch_config_cntr() prototype to include/linux/resctrl.h.
   Changed resctrl_arch_config_cntr() to retun void from int to simplify few call
   sequences.

   Added the event configuration details inside the evt_list in monitor domains.
   The avoids the need for new structure mbm_assign_config. 

   Passed evtid to functions resctrl_alloc_config_cntr() and resctrl_assign_cntr_event().
   Event configuration value can be easily obtained from mon_evt list.

   Added new patch to pass the entire struct rdtgroup to __mon_event_count(),
   mbm_update(), and related functions. We can easily get RMID,CLOSID etc from rdtgroup.

   Added new function __cntr_id_read_phys() to handle ABMC event reading.

   Added a new patch to hide BMEC related files when mbm_cntr_assign mode is enabled..
  
   Added the call resctrl_init_evt_configuration() to setup the event configuration during init.

   And few other commit message updates and user doc updates.

   Removed Reviewed-by from few patches as patches have changed due to FS/ARCH restructure.

   Let me know if I missed something.

v12:
   This version is kind of RFC series with a new interface.
   
   Removed Reviewed-by tag on few patches when the patch has changed.

   Moved BMEC related patches (1 and 2) to beginning of the series.
   Removed the dependancy on BMEC to ABMC feature.

   Removed the un-necessary initialization of mon_config_info structure.
   Changed wrmsrl instead of wrmsr to address the below comment.

   Replaced seq_puts(s, ";") with seq_putc(s, ';');
   Added missing rdt_last_cmd_clear() in resctrl_available_mbm_cntrs_show().

   Added the check to reset the architecture-specific state only when assign is requested.

   Added evt_cfg as the parameter to resctrl_arch_config_cntr() as the user will
   be passing the event configuration from /info/L3_MON/event_configs/.

   Changed the check in resctrl_alloc_config_cntr() to reduce the indentation.
   Fixed the handling error on first failure while assigning.
   Added new parameter event configuration (evt_cfg) to get the event configuration from user space.

   Added tte support for reading ABMC counters. This is bit involved change and affects lots of code.

   New patch to support event configurations via new counter_configs method.

   Removed mbm_cntr_reset() as it is not required while removing the group.

   Added new patch to handle auto assign on group creation ("mbm_assign_on_mkdir")

   Refactored the resctrl_assign_cntr_event().
   Added functionality to exit on the first error during assignment.
   Simplified mbm_cntr_free().
   Removed the function mbm_cntr_assigned(). Will be using mbm_cntr_get() to
   figure out if the counter is assigned or not.

   Fixed the static check warning with initializing dom_id in resctrl_process_flags()

   Added change log in each patch for specific changes.

v10:
   Major change is related to domain specific assignment.
   Added struct mbm_cntr_cfg inside mon domains. This will handle
   the domain specific assignments as discussed in below.
   https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CALPaoCj+zWq1vkHVbXYP0znJbe6Ke3PXPWjtri5AFgD9cQDCUg@mail.gmail.com/
   I did not see the need to add cntr_id in mbm_state structure. Not used in the code.
   Following patches take care of these changes.
   Patch 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18.
   
   Added __init attribute to cache_alloc_hsw_probe(). Followed function

   This is called both CNTR_MON and MON group creation.
   
   Call mbm_cntr_reset() when unmounted to clear all the assignments.
   
   Fixed the issue with finding the domain in multiple iterations in rdtgroup_process_flags().
   
   Printed full error message with domain information when assign fails.
   
   Taken care of other text comments in all the patches. Patch specific changes are in each patch.
   
   If I missed something please point me and it is not intentional.

v9:
   Patch 14 is a new addition. 
   Major change in patch 24.
   Moved the fix patch to address __init attribute to begining of the series.
   Fixed all the call sequences. Added additional Fixed tags.

   Added Reviewed-by where applicable.

   Took care of couple of minor merge conflicts with latest code.
   Re-ordered the MSR in couple of instances.

   Used MBM_EVENT_ARRAY_INDEX macro to get the event index.
   Introduced rdtgroup_cntr_id_init() to initialize the cntr_id

   Introduced new function resctrl_config_cntr to assign the counter, update
   the bitmap and reset the architectural state.
   Taken care of error handling(freeing the counter) when assignment fails.
  
   Changed rdtgroup_assign_cntrs() and rdtgroup_unassign_cntrs() to return void.
   Updated couple of rdtgroup_unassign_cntrs() calls properly.

   Fixed problem changing the mode to mbm_cntr_assign mode when it is
   not supported. Added extra checks to detect if systems supports it.
   
   https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/03b278b5-6c15-4d09-9ab7-3317e84a409e@intel.com/
   As discussed in the above comment, introduced resctrl_mon_event_config_set to
   handle IPI. But sending another IPI inside IPI causes problem. Kernel
   reports SMP warning. So, introduced resctrl_arch_update_cntr() to send the
   command directly.

   Fixed handling special case '//0=' and '//".
   Removed extra strstr() call in rdtgroup_mbm_assign_control_write().
   Added generic failure text when assignment operation fails.
   Corrected user documentation format texts.

v8:
  Patches are getting into final stages. 
  Couple of changes Patch 8, Patch 19 and Patch 23.
  Most of the other changes are related to rename and text message updates.

  Details are in each patch. Here is the summary.

  Renamed resctrl_arch_mbm_cntr_assign_configure to
            resctrl_arch_mbm_cntr_assign_set_one.

  Used the same IPI as event update to modify the assignment.
  Could not do the way we discussed in the thread.
  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/f77737ac-d3f6-3e4b-3565-564f79c86ca8@amd.com/
  Needed to figure out event type to update the configuration.

  Moved unassign first and assign during the assign modification.
  Assign none "_" takes priority. Cannot be mixed with other flags.
  Updated the documentation and .rst file format. htmldoc looks ok.

v7:
   Major changes are related to FS and arch codes separation.
   Changed few interface names based on feedback.
   Here are the summary and each patch contains changes specific the patch.

   Removed WARN_ON for num_mbm_cntrs. Decided to dynamically allocate the bitmap.
   WARN_ON is not required anymore.
 
   Renamed the function resctrl_arch_get_abmc_enabled() to resctrl_arch_mbm_cntr_assign_enabled().

   Merged resctrl_arch_mbm_cntr_assign_disable, resctrl_arch_mbm_cntr_assign_disable
   and renamed to resctrl_arch_mbm_cntr_assign_set(). Passed the struct rdt_resource
   to these functions.

   Removed resctrl_arch_reset_rmid_all() from arch code. This will be done from FS the caller.

   Updated the descriptions/commit log in resctrl.rst to generic text. Removed ABMC references.
   Renamed mbm_mode to mbm_assign_mode.
   Renamed mbm_control to  mbm_assign_control.

  Removed the references of ABMC from user interfaces.

  Simplified the parsing (strsep(&token, "//") in rdtgroup_mbm_assign_control_write().
  Added mutex lock in rdtgroup_mbm_assign_control_write() while processing.

  Thomas Gleixner asked us to update  https://gitlab.com/x86-cpuid.org/x86-cpuid-db. 
  It needs internal approval. We are working on it.

v6:
  We still need to finalize few interface details on mbm_assign_mode and mbm_assign_control
  in case of ABMC and Soft-ABMC. We can continue the discussion with this series.

  Added support for domain-id '*' to update all the domains at once.
  Fixed assign interface to allocate the counter if counter is
  not assigned.   
  Fixed unassign interface to free the counter if the counter is not
  assigned in any of the domains.

  Renamed abmc_capable to mbm_cntr_assignable.

  Renamed abmc_enabled to mbm_cntr_assign_enabled.
  Used msr_set_bit and msr_clear_bit for msr updates.
  Renamed resctrl_arch_abmc_enable() to resctrl_arch_mbm_cntr_assign_enable().
  Renamed resctrl_arch_abmc_disable() to resctrl_arch_mbm_cntr_assign_disable().

  Changed the display name from num_cntrs to num_mbm_cntrs.

  Removed the variable mbm_cntrs_free_map_len. This is not required.
  Removed the call mbm_cntrs_init() in arch code. This needs to be done at higher level.
  Used DECLARE_BITMAP to initialize mbm_cntrs_free_map.
  Removed unused config value definitions.

  Introduced mbm_cntr_map to track counters at domain level. With this
  we dont need to send MSR read to read the counter configuration.

  Separated all the counter id management to upper level in FS code.

  Added checks to detect "Unassigned" before reading the RMID.

  More details in each patch.

v5:
  Rebase changes (because of SNC support)

  Interface changes.
   /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_assign to /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_assign_mode.
   /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_assign_control to /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_assign_control.

  Added few arch specific routines.
  resctrl_arch_get_abmc_enabled.
  resctrl_arch_abmc_enable.
  resctrl_arch_abmc_disable.

  Few renames
   num_cntrs_free_map -> mbm_cntrs_free_map
   num_cntrs_init -> mbm_cntrs_init
   arch_domain_mbm_evt_config -> resctrl_arch_mbm_evt_config

  Introduced resctrl_arch_event_config_get and
    resctrl_arch_event_config_set() to update event configuration.

  Removed mon_state field mongroup. Added MON_CNTR_UNSET to initialize counters.

  Renamed ctr_id to cntr_id for the hardware counter.
 
  Report "Unassigned" in case the user attempts to read the events without assigning the counter.
  
  ABMC is enabled during the boot up. Can be enabled or disabled later.

  Fixed opcode and flags combination.
    '=_" is valid.
    "-_" amd "+_" is not valid.

 Added all the comments as far as I know. If I missed something, it is not intentional.

v4: 
  Main change is domain specific event assignment.
  Kept the ABMC feature as a default.
  Dynamcic switching between ABMC and mbm_legacy is still allowed.
  We are still not clear about mount option.
  Moved the monitoring related data in resctrl_mon structure from rdt_resource.
  Fixed the display of legacy and ABMC mode.
  Used bimap APIs when possible.
  Removed event configuration read from MSRs. We can use the
  internal saved data.(patch 12)
  Added more comments about L3_QOS_ABMC_CFG MSR.
  Added IPIs to read the assignment status for each domain (patch 18 and 19)
  More details in each patch.

v3:
   This series adds the support for global assignment mode discussed in
   the thread. https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20231201005720.235639-1-babu.moger@amd.com/
   Removed the individual assignment mode and included the global assignment interface.
   Added following interface files.
   a. /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign
      Used for displaying the current assignment mode and switch between
      ABMC and legacy mode.
   b. /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign_control
      Used for lising the groups assignment mode and modify the assignment states.
   c. Most of the changes are related to the new interface.
   d. Addressed the comments from Reinette, James and Peter.
   e. Hope I have addressed most of the major feedbacks discussed. If I missed
      something then it is not intentional. Please feel free to comment.
   f. Sending this as an RFC as per Reinette's comment. So, this is still open
      for discussion.

v2:
   a. Major change is the way ABMC is enabled. Earlier, user needed to remount
      with -o abmc to enable ABMC feature. Removed that option now.
      Now users can enable ABMC by "$echo 1 to /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign_enable".
     
   b. Added new word 21 to x86/cpufeatures.h.

   c. Display unsupported if user attempts to read the events when ABMC is enabled
      and event is not assigned.

   d. Display monitor_state as "Unsupported" when ABMC is disabled.
  
   e. Text updates and rebase to latest tip tree (as of Jan 18).
 
   f. This series is still work in progress. I am yet to hear from ARM developers.

New:  Fix incorrect iommu_groups with PCIe ACS
[PATCH v3 00/11] Fix incorrect iommu_groups with PCIe ACS
Author: Jason Gunthorpe <jgg@nvidia.com>

The series patches have extensive descriptions as to the problem and
solution, but in short the ACS flags are not analyzed according to the
spec to form the iommu_groups that VFIO is expecting for security.

ACS is an egress control only. For a path the ACS flags on each hop only
effect what other devices the TLP is allowed to reach. It does not prevent
other devices from reaching into this path.

For VFIO if device A is permitted to access device B's MMIO then A and B
must be grouped together. This says that even if a path has isolating ACS
flags on each hop, off-path devices with non-isolating ACS can still reach
into that path and must be grouped gother.

For switches, a PCIe topology like:

                               -- DSP 02:00.0 -> End Point A
 Root 00:00.0 -> USP 01:00.0 --|
                               -- DSP 02:03.0 -> End Point B

Will generate unique single device groups for every device even if ACS is
not enabled on the two DSP ports. It should at least group A/B together
because no ACS means A can reach the MMIO of B. This is a serious failure
for the VFIO security model.

For multi-function-devices, a PCIe topology like:

                  -- MFD 00:1f.0 ACS not supported
  Root 00:00.00 --|- MFD 00:1f.2 ACS not supported
                  |- MFD 00:1f.6 ACS = REQ_ACS_FLAGS

Will group [1f.0, 1f.2] and 1f.6 gets a single device group. However from
a spec perspective each device should get its own group, because ACS not
supported can assume no loopback is possible by spec.

For root-ports a PCIe topology like:
                                         -- Dev 01:00.0
  Root  00:00.00 --- Root Port 00:01.0 --|
                  |                      -- Dev 01:00.1
		  |- Dev 00:17.0

Previously would group [00:01.0, 01:00.0, 01:00.1] together if there is no
ACS capability in the root port.

While ACS on root ports is underspecified in the spec, it should still
function as an egress control and limit access to either the MMIO of the
root port itself, or perhaps some other devices upstream of the root
complex - 00:17.0 perhaps in this example.

Historically the grouping in Linux has assumed the root port routes all
traffic into the TA/IOMMU and never bypasses the TA to go to other
functions in the root complex. Following the new understanding that ACS is
required for internal loopback also treat root ports with no ACS
capability as lacking internal loopback as well.

There is also some confusing spec language about how ACS and SRIOV works
which this series does not address.


This entire series goes further and makes some additional improvements to
the ACS validation found while studying this problem. The groups around a
PCIe to PCI bridge are shrunk to not include the PCIe bridge.

The last patches implement "ACS Enhanced" on top of it. Due to how ACS
Enhanced was defined as a non-backward compatible feature it is important
to get SW support out there.

Due to the potential of iommu_groups becoming wider and thus non-usable
for VFIO this should go to a linux-next tree to give it some more
exposure.

I have now tested this a few systems I could get:

 - Various Intel client systems:
   * Raptor Lake, with VMD enabled and using the real_dev mechanism
   * 6/7th generation 100 Series/C320
   * 5/6th generation 100 Series/C320 with a NIC MFD quirk
   * Tiger Lake
   * 5/6th generation Sunrise Point

  The 6/7th gen system has a root port without an ACS capability and it
  becomes ungrouped as described above.

  All systems have changes, the MFDs in the root complex all become ungrouped.

 - NVIDIA Grace system with 5 different PCI switches from two vendors
   Bug fix widening the iommu_groups works as expected here

This is on github: https://github.com/jgunthorpe/linux/commits/pcie_switch_groups

v3:
 - Rebase to v6.17-rc4
 - Drop the quirks related patches
 - Change the MFD logic to process no ACS cap as meaning no internal
   loopback. This avoids creating non-isolated groups for MFD root ports in
   common AMD and Intel systems
 - Fix matching MFDs to ignore SRIOV VFs
 - Fix some kbuild splats
v2: https://patch.msgid.link/r/0-v2-4a9b9c983431+10e2-pcie_switch_groups_jgg@nvidia.com
 - Revise comments and commit messages
 - Rename struct pci_alias_set to pci_reachable_set
 - Make more sense of the special bus->self = NULL case for SRIOV
 - Add pci_group_alloc_non_isolated() for readability
 - Rename BUS_DATA_PCI_UNISOLATED to BUS_DATA_PCI_NON_ISOLATED
 - Propogate BUS_DATA_PCI_NON_ISOLATED downstream from a MFD in case a MFD
   function is a bridge
 - New patches to add pci_mfd_isolation() to retain more cases of narrow
   groups on MFDs with missing ACS.
 - Redescribe the MFD related change as a bug fix. For a MFD to be
   isolated all functions must have egress control on their P2P.

New:  KVM: WQ_PERCPU added to alloc_workqueue users
[PATCH 1/1] KVM: WQ_PERCPU added to alloc_workqueue users
Author: Marco Crivellari <marco.crivellari@suse.com>

Currently if a user enqueue a work item using schedule_delayed_work() the
used wq is "system_wq" (per-cpu wq) while queue_delayed_work() use
WORK_CPU_UNBOUND (used when a cpu is not specified). The same applies to
schedule_work() that is using system_wq and queue_work(), that makes use
again of WORK_CPU_UNBOUND.
This lack of consistentcy cannot be addressed without refactoring the API.

alloc_workqueue() treats all queues as per-CPU by default, while unbound
workqueues must opt-in via WQ_UNBOUND.

This default is suboptimal: most workloads benefit from unbound queues,
allowing the scheduler to place worker threads where they’re needed and
reducing noise when CPUs are isolated.

This default is suboptimal: most workloads benefit from unbound queues,
allowing the scheduler to place worker threads where they’re needed and
reducing noise when CPUs are isolated.

This patch adds a new WQ_PERCPU flag to explicitly request the use of
the per-CPU behavior. Both flags coexist for one release cycle to allow
callers to transition their calls.

Once migration is complete, WQ_UNBOUND can be removed and unbound will
become the implicit default.

With the introduction of the WQ_PERCPU flag (equivalent to !WQ_UNBOUND),
any alloc_workqueue() caller that doesn’t explicitly specify WQ_UNBOUND
must now use WQ_PERCPU.

All existing users have been updated accordingly.

New:  KVM: replace wq users and add WQ_PERCPU to alloc_workqueue() users
[PATCH 0/1] KVM: replace wq users and add WQ_PERCPU to alloc_workqueue() users
Author: Marco Crivellari <marco.crivellari@suse.com>

Hi!

Below is a summary of a discussion about the Workqueue API and cpu isolation
considerations. Details and more information are available here:

        "workqueue: Always use wq_select_unbound_cpu() for WORK_CPU_UNBOUND."
        https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250221112003.1dSuoGyc@linutronix.de/

=== Current situation: problems ===

Let's consider a nohz_full system with isolated CPUs: wq_unbound_cpumask is
set to the housekeeping CPUs, for !WQ_UNBOUND the local CPU is selected.

This leads to different scenarios if a work item is scheduled on an isolated
CPU where "delay" value is 0 or greater then 0:
        schedule_delayed_work(, 0);

This will be handled by __queue_work() that will queue the work item on the
current local (isolated) CPU, while:

        schedule_delayed_work(, 1);

Will move the timer on an housekeeping CPU, and schedule the work there.

Currently if a user enqueue a work item using schedule_delayed_work() the
used wq is "system_wq" (per-cpu wq) while queue_delayed_work() use
WORK_CPU_UNBOUND (used when a cpu is not specified). The same applies to
schedule_work() that is using system_wq and queue_work(), that makes use
again of WORK_CPU_UNBOUND.

This lack of consistentcy cannot be addressed without refactoring the API.

=== Plan and future plans ===

This patchset is the first stone on a refactoring needed in order to
address the points aforementioned; it will have a positive impact also
on the cpu isolation, in the long term, moving away percpu workqueue in
favor to an unbound model.

These are the main steps:
1)  API refactoring (that this patch is introducing)
    -   Make more clear and uniform the system wq names, both per-cpu and
        unbound. This to avoid any possible confusion on what should be
        used.

    -   Introduction of WQ_PERCPU: this flag is the complement of WQ_UNBOUND,
        introduced in this patchset and used on all the callers that are not
        currently using WQ_UNBOUND.

        WQ_UNBOUND will be removed in a future release cycle.

        Most users don't need to be per-cpu, because they don't have
        locality requirements, because of that, a next future step will be
        make "unbound" the default behavior.

2)  Check who really needs to be per-cpu
    -   Remove the WQ_PERCPU flag when is not strictly required.

3)  Add a new API (prefer local cpu)
    -   There are users that don't require a local execution, like mentioned
        above; despite that, local execution yeld to performance gain.

        This new API will prefer the local execution, without requiring it.

=== Introduced Changes by this series ===

1) [P 1] add WQ_PERCPU to remaining alloc_workqueue() users

        Every alloc_workqueue() caller should use one among WQ_PERCPU or
        WQ_UNBOUND. This is actually enforced warning if both or none of them
        are present at the same time.

        WQ_UNBOUND will be removed in a next release cycle.

=== For Maintainers ===

There are prerequisites for this series, already merged in the master branch.
The commits are:

128ea9f6ccfb6960293ae4212f4f97165e42222d ("workqueue: Add system_percpu_wq and
system_dfl_wq")

New:  KVM: arm64: Mark freed S2 MMUs as invalid
[PATCH] KVM: arm64: Mark freed S2 MMUs as invalid
Author: Marc Zyngier <maz@kernel.org>

When freeing an S2 MMU, we free the associated pgd, but omit to
mark the structure as invalid. Subsequently, a call to
kvm_nested_s2_unmap() would pick these invalid S2 MMUs and
pass them down the teardown path.

This ends up with a nasty warning as we try to unmap an unallocated
set of page tables.

Fix this by making the S2 MMU invalid on freeing the pgd by calling
kvm_init_nested_s2_mmu().

New:  KVM: arm64: nv: Optimize unmapping of shadow S2-MMU tables
[PATCH] KVM: arm64: nv: Optimize unmapping of shadow S2-MMU tables
Author: Ganapatrao Kulkarni <gankulkarni@os.amperecomputing.com>

As of commit ec14c272408a ("KVM: arm64: nv: Unmap/flush shadow
stage 2 page tables"), an unmap of a canonical IPA range mapped at L1
triggers invalidation in L1 S2-MMU and in all active shadow (L2) S2-MMU
tables. Because there is no direct mapping to locate the corresponding
shadow IPAs, the code falls back to a full S2-MMU page-table walk and
invalidation across the entire L1 address space.

For 4K pages this causes roughly 256K loop iterations (about 8M for
64K pages) per unmap, which can severely impact performance on large
systems and even cause soft lockups during NV (L1/L2) boots with many
CPUs and large memory. It also causes long delays during L1 reboot.

This patch adds a maple-tree-based lookup that records canonical-IPA to
shadow-IPA mappings whenever a page is mapped into any shadow (L2)
table. On unmap, the lookup is used to target only those shadow IPAs
which are fully or partially mapped in shadow S2-MMU tables, avoiding
a full-address-space walk and unnecessary unmap/flush operations.

The lookup is updated on map/unmap operations so entries remain
consistent with shadow table state. Use it during unmap to invalidate
only affected shadow IPAs, avoiding unnecessary CPU work and reducing
latency when shadow mappings are sparse.
