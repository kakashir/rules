[PATCH] selftests/kvm: Use vcpus count instead of hardcoded 0xff in test_icr
Author: Sukrut Heroorkar <hsukrut3@gmail.com>

Replace the hardcoded 0xff in test_icr() with the actual number of vcpus
created for the vm. This address the existing TODO and keeps the test
correct if it is ever run with multiple vcpus.
