[PATCH] KVM: selftests: Include missing uapi header for *_VECTOR definitions
Author: Ankit Khushwaha <ankitkhushwaha.linux@gmail.com>

The exception vector constants CP_VECTOR, HV_VECTOR, VC_VECTOR, and
SX_VECTOR are used in ex_str(), but the header that defines
them is not included. Other exception vectors are picked up through
indirect includes, but these four are not, which leads to unresolved
identifiers during selftest builds.

    lib/x86/processor.c: In function ‘ex_str’:
    lib/x86/processor.c:52:17: error: ‘CP_VECTOR’ undeclared
    lib/x86/processor.c:53:17: error: ‘HV_VECTOR’ undeclared
    lib/x86/processor.c:54:17: error: ‘VC_VECTOR’ undeclared
    lib/x86/processor.c:55:17: error: ‘SX_VECTOR’ undeclared

These vector definitions live in:

    tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h

Add the missing include the userspace API exception vector constants.
