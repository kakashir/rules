New:  vsock: a per-net vsock NS mode state
[PATCH RFC net-next v4 01/12] vsock: a per-net vsock NS mode state
Author: Bobby Eshleman <bobbyeshleman@gmail.com>


Add the per-net vsock NS mode state. This only adds the structure for
holding the mode necessary and some of the definitions, but does not
integrate the functionality yet.

New:  vsock: add namespace support to
[PATCH RFC net-next v4 00/12] vsock: add namespace support to
Author: Bobby Eshleman <bobbyeshleman@gmail.com>

This series adds namespace support to vhost-vsock. It does not add
namespaces to any of the guest transports (virtio-vsock, hyperv, or
vmci).

The current revision only supports two modes: local or global. Local
mode is complete isolation of namespaces, while global mode is complete
sharing between namespaces of CIDs (the original behavior).

Future may include supporting a mixed mode, which I expect to be more
complicated because socket lookups will have to include new logic and
API changes to behave differently based on if the lookup is part of a
mixed mode CID allocation, a global CID allocation, a mixed-to-global
connection (allowed), or a global-to-mixed connection (not allowed).

Modes are per-netns and write-once. This allows a system to configure
namespaces independently (some may share CIDs, others are completely
isolated). This also supports future mixed use cases, where there may be
namespaces in global mode spinning up VMs while there are
mixed mode namespaces that provide services to the VMs, but are not
allowed to allocate from the global CID pool.

Thanks again for everyone's help and reviews!

New:  x86/cpufeatures: Add a CPU feature bit for MSR
[PATCH v3 1/6] x86/cpufeatures: Add a CPU feature bit for MSR
Author: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>


The immediate form of MSR access instructions are primarily motivated
by performance, not code size: by having the MSR number in an immediate,
it is available *much* earlier in the pipeline, which allows the
hardware much more leeway about how a particular MSR is handled.

Use a scattered CPU feature bit for MSR immediate form instructions.

New:  KVM: VMX: Handle the immediate form of MSR instructions
[PATCH v3 0/6] KVM: VMX: Handle the immediate form of MSR instructions
Author: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

On behalf of Xin, to avoid having to resolve conflicts when applying.
This applies on the fastpath cleanup series:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250805190526.1453366-1-seanjc@google.com

This patch set handles two newly introduced VM exit reasons associated
with the immediate form of MSR instructions to ensure proper
virtualization of these instructions.

The immediate form of MSR access instructions are primarily motivated
by performance, not code size: by having the MSR number in an immediate,
it is available *much* earlier in the pipeline, which allows the
hardware much more leeway about how a particular MSR is handled.

For proper virtualization of the immediate form of MSR instructions,
Intel VMX architecture adds the following changes:

  1) The immediate form of RDMSR uses VM exit reason 84.

  2) The immediate form of WRMSRNS uses VM exit reason 85.

  3) For both VM exit reasons 84 and 85, the exit qualification is set
     to the MSR address causing the VM exit.

  4) Bits 3 ~ 6 of the VM exit instruction information field represent
     the operand register used in the immediate form of MSR instruction.

  5) The VM-exit instruction length field records the size of the
     immediate form of the MSR instruction.

Note: The VMX specification for the immediate form of MSR instructions
was inadvertently omitted from the last published ISE, but it will be
included in the upcoming edition.

Linux bare metal support of the immediate form of MSR instructions is
still under development; however, the KVM support effort is proceeding
independently of the bare metal implementation.

v3:
 - Rebase on the fastpath cleanups.
 - Split patches to better isolate the functional changes.
 - Massage and expand on a changelogs.
 - Make a handful of (mostly) stylistic changes (shouldn't affect
   functionality, key word "should").

New:  KVM: SVM: Skip fastpath emulation on VM-Exit if next
[PATCH 01/18] KVM: SVM: Skip fastpath emulation on VM-Exit if next
Author: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

Skip the WRMSR and HLT fastpaths in SVM's VM-Exit handler if the next RIP
isn't valid, e.g. because KVM is running with nrips=false.  SVM must
decode and emulate to skip the instruction if the CPU doesn't provide the
next RIP, and getting the instruction bytes to decode requires reading
guest memory.  Reading guest memory through the emulator can fault, i.e.
can sleep, which is disallowed since the fastpath handlers run with IRQs
disabled.

Note, this is essentially a reapply of commit 5c30e8101e8d ("KVM: SVM:
Skip WRMSR fastpath on VM-Exit if next RIP isn't valid"), but with
different justification (KVM now grabs SRCU when skipping the instruction
for other reasons).

New:  KVM: x86: Fastpath cleanups and PMU prep work
[PATCH 00/18] KVM: x86: Fastpath cleanups and PMU prep work
Author: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

This is a prep series for the mediated PMU, and for Xin's series to add
support for the immediate forms of RDMSR and WRMSRNS (I'll post a v3 of
that series on top of this).

The first half cleans up a variety of warts and flaws in the VM-Exit fastpath
handlers.  The second half cleans up the PMU code related to "triggering"
instruction retired and branches retired events.  The end goal of the two
halves (other than general cleanup) is to be able bail from the fastpath when
using the mediated PMU and the guest is counting instructions retired, with
minimal overhead, e.g. without having to acquire SRCU.

Because the mediated PMU context switches PMU state _outside_ of the fastpath,
the mediated PMU won't be able to increment PMCs in the fastpath, and so won't
be able to skip emulated instructions in the fastpath if the vCPU is counting
instructions retired.

The last patch to handle INVD in the fastpath is a bit dubious.  It works just
fine, but it's dangerously close to "just because we can, doesn't mean we
should" territory.  I added INVD to the fastpath before I realized that
MSR_IA32_TSC_DEADLINE could be handled in the fastpath irrespective of the
VMX preemption timer, i.e. on AMD CPUs.  But being able to use INVD to test
the fastpath is still super convenient, as there are no side effects (unless
someone ran the test on bare metal :-D), no register constraints, and no
vCPU model requirements.  So, I kept it, because I couldn't come up with a
good reason not to.

New:  KVM: s390: Fix incorrect usage of mmu_notifier_register()
[PATCH v2 1/2] KVM: s390: Fix incorrect usage of mmu_notifier_register()
Author: Claudio Imbrenda <imbrenda@linux.ibm.com>

If mmu_notifier_register() fails, for example because a signal was
pending, the mmu_notifier will not be registered. But when the VM gets
destroyed, it will get unregistered anyway and that will cause one
extra mmdrop(), which will eventually cause the mm of the process to
be freed too early, and cause a use-after free.

This bug happens rarely, and only when secure guests are involved.

The solution is to check the return value of mmu_notifier_register()
and return it to the caller (ultimately it will be propagated all the
way to userspace). In case of -EINTR, userspace will try again.

Author: Claudio Imbrenda <imbrenda@linux.ibm.com>

This small series fixes two bugs in s390 KVM. One is small and trivial,
the other is pretty bad.

* The wrong type of flag was being passed to vcpu_dat_fault_handler();
  it expects a FOLL_* flag, but a FAULT_FLAG_* was passed instead.
* Due to incorrect usage of mmu_notifier_register(), in some rare cases
  when running a secure guest, the struct mm for the userspace process
  would get freed too early and cause a use-after-free.

v1->v2
* Rename the parameters of __kvm_s390_handle_dat_fault() and
  vcpu_dat_fault_handler() from flags to foll (thanks Christian)

[PATCH] vfio/type1: Absorb num_pages_contiguous()
