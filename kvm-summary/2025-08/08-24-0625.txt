New:  RISC-V: KVM: Set initial value of hedeleg in kvm_arch_vcpu_create()
[PATCH v3 1/6] RISC-V: KVM: Set initial value of hedeleg in kvm_arch_vcpu_create()
Author: Anup Patel <apatel@ventanamicro.com>

The hedeleg may be updated by ONE_REG interface before the VCPU
is run at least once hence set the initial value of hedeleg in
kvm_arch_vcpu_create() instead of kvm_riscv_vcpu_setup_config().

New:  ONE_REG interface for SBI FWFT extension
[PATCH v3 0/6] ONE_REG interface for SBI FWFT extension
Author: Anup Patel <apatel@ventanamicro.com>

This series adds ONE_REG interface for SBI FWFT extension implemented
by KVM RISC-V. This was missed out in accepted SBI FWFT patches for
KVM RISC-V.

These patches can also be found in the riscv_kvm_fwft_one_reg_v3 branch
at: https://github.com/avpatel/linux.git

Changes since v2:
 - Re-based on latest KVM RISC-V queue
 - Improved FWFT ONE_REG interface to allow enabling/disabling each
   FWFT feature from KVM userspace

Changes since v1:
 - Dropped have_state in PATCH4 as suggested by Drew
 - Added Drew's Reviewed-by in appropriate patches
