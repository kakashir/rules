New:  LoongArch: KVM: Fix kvm_device leak in kvm_pch_pic_destroy
[PATCH 1/3] LoongArch: KVM: Fix kvm_device leak in kvm_pch_pic_destroy
Author: Qiang Ma <maqianga@uniontech.com>

In kvm_ioctl_create_device(), kvm_device has allocated memory,
kvm_device->destroy() seems to be supposed to free its kvm_device
struct, but kvm_pch_pic_destroy() is not currently doing this,
that would lead to a memory leak.

So, fix it.
