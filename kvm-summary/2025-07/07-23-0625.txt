New:  LoongArch: KVM: Move kvm_iocsr tracepoint out of generic
[PATCH] LoongArch: KVM: Move kvm_iocsr tracepoint out of generic
Author: Steven Rostedt <rostedt@goodmis.org>


The tracepoint kvm_iocsr is only used by the loongarch architecture. As
trace events can take up to 5K of memory, move this tracepoint into the
loongarch specific tracing file so that it doesn't waste memory for all
other architectures.

New:  x86/tdx: Eliminate duplicate code in tdx_clear_page()
[PATCH V3 1/2] x86/tdx: Eliminate duplicate code in tdx_clear_page()
Author: Adrian Hunter <adrian.hunter@intel.com>

tdx_clear_page() and reset_tdx_pages() duplicate the TDX page clearing
logic.  Rename reset_tdx_pages() to tdx_quirk_reset_paddr() and use it
in place of tdx_clear_page().

The new name reflects that, in fact, the clearing is necessary only for
hardware with a certain quirk.  That is dealt with in a subsequent patch
but doing the rename here avoids additional churn.

Note reset_tdx_pages() is slightly different from tdx_clear_page() because,
more appropriately, it uses mb() in place of __mb().  Except when extra
debugging is enabled (kcsan at present), mb() just calls __mb().

New:  x86/kvm: Prefer native qspinlock for dedicated vCPUs irrespective of PV_UNHALT
[PATCH][v2] x86/kvm: Prefer native qspinlock for dedicated vCPUs irrespective of PV_UNHALT
Author: lirongqing <lirongqing@baidu.com>


The commit b2798ba0b876 ("KVM: X86: Choose qspinlock when dedicated
physical CPUs are available") states that when PV_DEDICATED=1
(vCPU has dedicated pCPU), qspinlock should be preferred regardless of
PV_UNHALT.  However, the current implementation doesn't reflect this: when
PV_UNHALT=0, we still use virt_spin_lock() even with dedicated pCPUs.

This is suboptimal because:
1. Native qspinlocks should outperform virt_spin_lock() for dedicated
   vCPUs irrespective of HALT exiting
2. virt_spin_lock() should only be preferred when vCPUs may be preempted
   (non-dedicated case)

So reorder the PV spinlock checks to:
1. First handle dedicated pCPU case (disable virt_spin_lock_key)
2. Second check single CPU, and nopvspin configuration
3. Only then check PV_UNHALT support

This ensures we always use native qspinlock for dedicated vCPUs, delivering
pretty performance gains at high contention levels.

New:  x86/kvm: Downgrade host poll messages to pr_debug_once()
[PATCH] x86/kvm: Downgrade host poll messages to pr_debug_once()
Author: lirongqing <lirongqing@baidu.com>


The current host-side polling messages are misleading, as they will be
printed when the hypervisor intentionally disables polling (by providing
MWAIT to the guest) rather than due to version incompatibility. so
Downgrade to pr_debug_once() to prevent spurious log messages.

New:  x86/cpuid: Remove transitional <asm/cpuid.h> header
[PATCH v3 1/6] x86/cpuid: Remove transitional <asm/cpuid.h> header
Author: Ahmed S. Darwish <darwi@linutronix.de>

All CPUID call sites were updated at commit:

    968e30006807 ("x86/cpuid: Set <asm/cpuid/api.h> as the main CPUID header")

to include <asm/cpuid/api.h> instead of <asm/cpuid.h>.

The <asm/cpuid.h> header was still retained as a wrapper, just in case
some new code in -next started using it.  Now that everything is merged
to Linus' tree, remove the header.

New:  x86: Disentangle <asm/processor.h> dependency on CPUID headers
[PATCH v3 0/6] x86: Disentangle <asm/processor.h> dependency on CPUID headers
Author: Ahmed S. Darwish <darwi@linutronix.de>

Hi,

This series stops <asm/processor.h> from including <asm/cpuid/api.h>
since the former has no need for the latter.

For this to work, modify all CPUID call sites which implicitly include
the CPUID <asm/cpuid/api.h> header to explicitly include it instead.

Note, this allows the CPUID API header to include <asm/processor.h>
without inducing a circular dependency — which is needed for the upcoming
CPUID model and parser.


Changelog v3
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* For the KVM CPUID call sites:

    arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c
    arch/x86/kvm/svm/sev.c
    arch/x86/kvm/svm/svm.c
    arch/x86/kvm/vmx/pmu_intel.c
    arch/x86/kvm/vmx/sgx.c
    arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c

  Let them explicitly include <asm/cpuid/api.h> instead of letting their
  internal arch/x86/kvm/cpuid.h header does it.  The latter header does
  not need the former, so making it include a itnot just for the sake of
  its call sites was not correct.

* While at it, modify /all/ call sites that use the CPUID API to
  explicitly include <asm/cpuid/api.h>.

  Previous iterations only modified the CPUID call sites which implicitly
  included the CPUID headers through <asm/processor.h>.  Since we're at
  it anyway, there's no reason not to complete the task across the whole
  kernel tree.

  Thus, also convert below arch/x86/ sites:

    arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c
    arch/x86/kernel/cpu/sgx/driver.c
    arch/x86/kernel/cpu/vmware.c
    arch/x86/kernel/jailhouse.c
    arch/x86/kernel/kvm.c
    arch/x86/mm/pti.c
    arch/x86/pci/xen.c
    arch/x86/xen/enlighten_hvm.c
    arch/x86/xen/pmu.c
    arch/x86/xen/time.c

  and below drivers/ sites:

    drivers/gpu/drm/gma500/mmu.c
    drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/dwmac-intel.c
    drivers/ras/amd/fmpm.c
    drivers/virt/acrn/hsm.c
    drivers/xen/events/events_base.c
    drivers/xen/grant-table.c
    drivers/xen/xenbus/xenbus_xs.c

  to explicitly include the CPUID API header.

* Fix the v2 i386 compilation error:

    https://lore.kernel.org/x86-cpuid/202507150403.hKKg9xjJ-lkp@intel.com

  by making drivers/char/agp/efficeon-agp.c explicitly include the CPUID
  API.

* Make sure that an "i386 allyesconfig" build is successful this time.

* Based on v6.16-rc7.


Changelog v2
~~~~~~~~~~~~

( [PATCH v2 0/6] x86: Disentangle <asm/processor.h> dependency on CPUID headers
  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250709203033.90125-1-darwi@linutronix.de )

Remove the <asm/cpuid/types.h> include from <asm/processor.h> since only
the upcoming CPUID model needed that — not current mainline code.  That
include was kept in v1, by mistake, because this series was originally
part of the CPUID model patch queue.

Due to the CPUID types include remove above, let
arch/x86/kvm/reverse_cpuid.h include <asm/cpuid/types.h> since it
references the CPUID_EAX..EDX macros.  At this series v1, the KVM header
implicitly included such CPUID types header through <asm/cpufeature.h>,
through <asm/processor.h>.

Drop the "x86/cpuid: Rename cpuid_leaf()/cpuid_subleaf() APIs" patch from
this series.  After a second look, it should be part of the CPUID model
PQ instead.


Changelog v1
~~~~~~~~~~~~

( [PATCH v1 0/7] x86: Disentangle <asm/processor.h> dependency on CPUID APIs
  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250612234010.572636-1-darwi@linutronix.de )

This series avoids including the full CPUID API from <asm/processor.h>.
That header only needs the CPUID data types and not the full API.

Let <asm/processor.h> include <asm/cpuid/types.h> instead of
<asm/cpuid/api.h>.

Modify all CPUID call sites which implicitly included the CPUID API
though <asm/processor.h> to explicitly include <asm/cpuid/api.h> instead.

This work prepares for an upcoming v4 of the CPUID model:

    [PATCH v3 00/44] x86: Introduce a centralized CPUID data model
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250612234010.572636-1-darwi@linutronix.de

where <asm/cpuid/api.h> needs to include <asm/processor.h>, thus creating
a circular dependency if not resolved beforehand…  Patches 1->19 of the
v3 above had parts of this series circular dependency disentanglement.

Per Boris' remarks above, merge the header includes reorderings into two
patches only: one patch for x86 and one for drivers.

The 0-day bot x86-32 compilation error:

    Re: [PATCH v3 41/44] x86/cpu: <asm/processor.h>: Do not include CPUID…
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/202506132039.imS2Pflx-lkp@intel.com

is also fixed in this series.

Beside the call sites converted at CPUID model v3 above, this series also
switches below files:

    arch/x86/kernel/cpu/microcode/core.c
    arch/x86/kernel/cpu/microcode/intel.c
    arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mshyperv.c
    drivers/cpufreq/longrun.c
    drivers/cpufreq/powernow-k7.c
    drivers/cpufreq/powernow-k8.c

to explicitly include <asm/cpuid/api.h>.

Based on v6.16-rc5.

Thanks!

New:  KVM: x86: Advance guest TSC after deep suspend.
[PATCH v8 1/3] KVM: x86: Advance guest TSC after deep suspend.
Author: Suleiman Souhlal <suleiman@google.com>

Try to advance guest TSC to current time after suspend when the host
TSCs went backwards.

This makes the behavior consistent between suspends where host TSC
resets and suspends where it doesn't, such as suspend-to-idle, where
in the former case if the host TSC resets, the guests' would
previously be "frozen" due to KVM's backwards TSC prevention, while
in the latter case they would advance.

New:  KVM: x86: Include host suspended time in steal time
[PATCH v8 0/3] KVM: x86: Include host suspended time in steal time
Author: Suleiman Souhlal <suleiman@google.com>

This series makes it so that the time that the host is suspended is
included in guests' steal time.

When the host resumes from a suspend, the guest thinks any task
that was running during the suspend ran for a long time, even though
the effective run time was much shorter, which can end up having
negative effects with scheduling.

To mitigate this issue, include the time that the host was
suspended in steal time, if the guest requests it, which lets the
guest subtract the duration from the tasks' runtime. Add new ABI 
to make this behavior opt-in per-guest.

In addition, make the guest TSC behavior consistent whether the
host TSC went backwards or not.

v8:
- Avoid #ifdef in function body.

v7: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250714033649.4024311-1-suleiman@google.com/
- Fix build.
- Make advancing TSC dependent on X86_64.

v6: https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20250709070450.473297-1-suleiman@google.com/
- Use true/false for bools.
- Indentation.
- Remove superfluous flag. 
- Use atomic operations for accumulating suspend duration.
- Reuse generic vcpu block/kick infrastructure instead of rolling our own.
- Add ABI to make the behavior opt-in per-guest.
- Add command line parameter to make guest use this.
- Reword commit messages in imperative mood.

v5: https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20250325041350.1728373-1-suleiman@google.com/
- Fix grammar mistakes in commit message.

v4: https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20250221053927.486476-1-suleiman@google.com/
- Advance guest TSC on suspends where host TSC goes backwards.
- Block vCPUs from running until resume notifier.
- Move suspend duration accounting out of machine-independent kvm to
  x86.
- Merge code and documentation patches.
- Reworded documentation.

v3: https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20250107042202.2554063-1-suleiman@google.com/
- Use PM notifier instead of syscore ops (kvm_suspend()/kvm_resume()),
  because the latter doesn't get called on shallow suspend.
- Don't call function under UACCESS.
- Whitespace.

v2: https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20240820043543.837914-1-suleiman@google.com/
- Accumulate suspend time at machine-independent kvm layer and track per-VCPU
  instead of per-VM.
- Document changes.

New:  Add SBI v3.0 PMU enhancements
[PATCH v4 0/9] Add SBI v3.0 PMU enhancements
Author: Atish Patra <atishp@rivosinc.com>

SBI v3.0 specification[1] added two new improvements to the PMU chaper.
The SBI v3.0 specification is frozen and under public review phase as
per the RISC-V International guidelines. 

1. Added an additional get_event_info function to query event availablity
in bulk instead of individual SBI calls for each event. This helps in
improving the boot time.

2. Raw event width allowed by the platform is widened to have 56 bits
with RAW event v2 as per new clarification in the priv ISA[2].

Apart from implementing these new features, this series improves the gpa
range check in KVM and updates the kvm SBI implementation to SBI v3.0.

The opensbi patches have been merged. This series can be found at [3].
