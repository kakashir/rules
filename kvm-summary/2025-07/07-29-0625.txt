New:  arch/x86/kvm/ioapic: Remove license boilerplate with bad FSF address
[PATCH] arch/x86/kvm/ioapic: Remove license boilerplate with bad FSF address
Author: Thomas Huth <thuth@redhat.com>


The Free Software Foundation does not reside in "59 Temple Place"
anymore, so we should not mention that address in the source code here.
But instead of updating the address to their current location, let's
rather drop the license boilerplate text here and use a proper SPDX
license identifier instead. The text talks about the "GNU *Lesser*
General Public License" and "any later version", so LGPL-2.1+ is the
right choice here.

New:  x86/kexec: Consolidate relocate_kernel() function parameters
[PATCH v5 1/7] x86/kexec: Consolidate relocate_kernel() function parameters
Author: Kai Huang <kai.huang@intel.com>

During kexec, the kernel jumps to the new kernel in relocate_kernel(),
which is implemented in assembly and both 32-bit and 64-bit have their
own version.

Currently, for both 32-bit and 64-bit, the last two parameters of the
relocate_kernel() are both 'unsigned int' but actually they only convey
a boolean, i.e., one bit information.  The 'unsigned int' has enough
space to carry two bits information therefore there's no need to pass
the two booleans in two separate 'unsigned int'.

Consolidate the last two function parameters of relocate_kernel() into a
single 'unsigned int' and pass flags instead.

Only consolidate the 64-bit version albeit the similar optimization can
be done for the 32-bit version too.  Don't bother changing the 32-bit
version while it is working (since assembly code change is required).

 v4 -> v5:
  - RELOC_KERNEL_HOST_MEM_ACTIVE -> RELOC_KERNEL_HOST_MEM_ENC_ACTIVE
    (Tom)
  - Add a comment to explain only RELOC_KERNEL_PRESERVE_CONTEXT is
    restored after jumping back from peer kernel for preserved_context
    kexec (pointed out by Tom).
  - Use testb instead of testq when comparing the flag with R11 to save
    3 bytes (Hpa).

 v4:
  - new patch

New:  TDX host: kexec/kdump support
[PATCH v5 0/7] TDX host: kexec/kdump support
Author: Kai Huang <kai.huang@intel.com>

This series is the latest attempt to support kexec on TDX host following
Dave's suggestion to use a percpu boolean to control WBINVD during
kexec.

Hi Tom/Boris,

I addressed Tom's comments in v4, I appreciate if you can review again.

v4 -> v5:
 - Address comments from Tom, Hpa and Chao (nothing major)
   - RELOC_KERNEL_HOST_MEM_ACTIVE -> RELOC_KERNEL_HOST_MEM_ENC_ACTIVE
     in patch 1 (Tom)
   - Add a comment to explain only RELOC_KERNEL_PRESERVE_CONTEXT is
     restored after jumping back from peer kernel for preserved_context
     kexec in patch 1.
   - Use testb instead of testq to save 3 bytes in patch 1 (Hpa)
   - Remove the unneeded 'ret' local variable in do_seamcall() (Chao)

v4: https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/cover.1752730040.git.kai.huang@intel.com/

v3 -> v4:
 - Rebase to latest tip/master.
 - Add a cleanup patch to consolidate relocate_kernel()'s last two
   function parameters -- Boris.
 - Address comments received -- please see individual patches.
 - Collect tags (Tom, Rick, binbin).

 v3: https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/cover.1750934177.git.kai.huang@intel.com/

(For more history please see v3 coverletter.)

=== More information ===

TDX private memory is memory that is encrypted with private Host Key IDs
(HKID).  If the kernel has ever enabled TDX, part of system memory
remains TDX private memory when kexec happens.  E.g., the PAMT (Physical
Address Metadata Table) pages used by the TDX module to track each TDX
memory page's state are never freed once the TDX module is initialized.
TDX guests also have guest private memory and secure-EPT pages.

After kexec, the new kernel will have no knowledge of which memory page
was used as TDX private page and can use all memory as regular memory.

1) Cache flush

Per TDX 1.5 base spec "8.6.1.Platforms not Using ACT: Required Cache
Flush and Initialization by the Host VMM", to support kexec for TDX, the
kernel needs to flush cache to make sure there's no dirty cachelines of
TDX private memory left over to the new kernel (when the TDX module
reports TDX_FEATURES.CLFLUSH_BEFORE_ALLOC as 1 in the global metadata for
the platform).  The kernel also needs to make sure there's no more TDX
activity (no SEAMCALL) after cache flush so that no new dirty cachelines
of TDX private memory are generated.

SME has similar requirement.  SME kexec support uses WBINVD to do the
cache flush.  WBINVD is able to flush cachelines associated with any
HKID.  Reuse the WBINVD introduced by SME to flush cache for TDX.

Currently the kernel explicitly checks whether the hardware supports SME
and only does WBINVD if true.  Instead of adding yet another TDX
specific check, this series uses a percpu boolean to indicate whether
WBINVD is needed on that CPU during kexec.

2) Reset TDX private memory using MOVDIR64B

The TDX spec (the aforementioned section) also suggests the kernel
*should* use MOVDIR64B to clear TDX private page before the kernel
reuses it as regular one.

However, in reality the situation can be more flexible.  Per TDX 1.5
base spec ("Table 16.2: Non-ACT Platforms Checks on Memory Reads in Ci
Mode" and "Table 16.3: Non-ACT Platforms Checks on Memory Reads in Li
Mode"), the read/write to TDX private memory using shared KeyID without
integrity check enabled will not poison the memory and cause machine
check.

Note on the platforms with ACT (Access Control Table), there's no
integrity check involved thus no machine check is possible to happen due
to memory read/write using different KeyIDs.

KeyID 0 (TME key) doesn't support integrity check.  This series chooses
to NOT reset TDX private memory but leave TDX private memory as-is to the
new kernel.  As mentioned above, in practice it is safe to do so.

3) One limitation

If the kernel has ever enabled TDX, after kexec the new kernel won't be
able to use TDX anymore.  This is because when the new kernel tries to
initialize TDX module it will fail on the first SEAMCALL due to the
module has already been initialized by the old kernel.

More (non-trivial) work will be needed for the new kernel to use TDX,
e.g., one solution is to just reload the TDX module from the location
where BIOS loads the TDX module (/boot/efi/EFI/TDX/).  This series
doesn't cover this, but leave this as future work.

4) Kdump support

This series also enables kdump with TDX, but no special handling is
needed for crash kexec (except turning on the Kconfig option):

 - kdump kernel uses reserved memory from the old kernel as system ram,
   and the old kernel will never use the reserved memory as TDX memory.
 - /proc/vmcore contains TDX private memory pages.  It's meaningless to
   read them, but it doesn't do any harm either.

5) TDX "partial write machine check" erratum

On the platform with TDX erratum, a partial write (a write transaction
of less than a cacheline lands at memory controller) to TDX private
memory poisons that memory, and a subsequent read triggers machine
check.  On those platforms, the kernel needs to reset TDX private memory
before jumping to the new kernel otherwise the new kernel may see
unexpected machine check.

The kernel currently doesn't track which page is TDX private memory.
It's not trivial to reset TDX private memory.  For simplicity, this
series simply disables kexec/kdump for such platforms.  This can be
enhanced in the future.
