New:  PCI: Add helper for checking if a PCI device is a display controller
[PATCH v7 1/9] PCI: Add helper for checking if a PCI device is a display controller
Author: Mario Limonciello <superm1@kernel.org>


Several places in the kernel do class shifting to match whether a
PCI device is display class.  Introduce a helper for those places to
use.

New:  Adjust fbcon console device detection
[PATCH v7 0/9] Adjust fbcon console device detection
Author: Mario Limonciello <superm1@kernel.org>


This series started out as changes to VGA arbiter to try to handle a case
of a system with 2 GPUs that are not VGA devices.  This was discussed
but decided not to overload the VGA arbiter for non VGA devices.

Instead move the x86 specific detection of framebuffer resources into x86
specific code that the fbcon can use to properly identify the primary
device. This code is still called from the VGA arbiter, and the logic does
not change there. To avoid regression default to VGA arbiter and only fall
back to looking up with x86 specific detection method.

In order for userspace to also be able to discover which device was the
primary video display device create a new sysfs file 'boot_display'.

A matching userspace implementation for this file is available here:

Dave Airlie has been pinged for a comment on this approach.
Dave had suggested in the past [1]:

"
 But yes if that doesn't work, then maybe we need to make the boot_vga
 flag mean boot_display_gpu, and fix it in the kernel
"

This was one of the approached tried in earlier revisions and it was
rejected in favor of creating a new sysfs file (which is what this
version does).

It is suggested that this series merge entirely through the PCI tree.
