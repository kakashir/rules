[PATCH] vhost: Fix typos in comments and clarity on alignof usage
Author: Alok Tiwari <alok.a.tiwari@oracle.com>

This patch fixes multiple typos and improves comment clarity across
vhost.c.
- Correct spelling errors: "thead" -> "thread", "RUNNUNG" -> "RUNNING"
  and "available".
- Improve comment by replacing informal comment ("Supersize me!")
  with a clear description.
- Use __alignof__ correctly on dereferenced pointer types for better
  readability and alignment with kernel documentation.

These changes enhance code readability and maintainability.
