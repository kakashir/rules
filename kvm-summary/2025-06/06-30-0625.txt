New:  vfio/mlx5: fix possible overflow in tracking max
[PATCH] vfio/mlx5: fix possible overflow in tracking max
Author: Artem Sadovnikov <a.sadovnikov@ispras.ru>

MLX cap pg_track_log_max_msg_size consists of 5 bits, value of which is
used as power of 2 for max_msg_size. This can lead to multiplication
overflow between max_msg_size (u32) and integer constant, and afterwards
incorrect value is being written to rq_size.

Fix this issue by extending max_msg_size up to u64 so multiplication will
be extended to u64.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.
