New:  Enable hstateen bits lazily for the KVM RISC-V Guests
[PATCH 0/5] Enable hstateen bits lazily for the KVM RISC-V Guests
Author: Atish Patra <atishp@rivosinc.com>

This series adds support for enabling hstateen bits lazily at runtime
instead of statically at bootime. The boot time enabling happens for
all the guests if the required extensions are present in the host and/or
guest. That may not be necessary if the guest never exercise that
feature. We can enable the hstateen bits that controls the access lazily
upon first access. This providers KVM more granular control of which
feature is enabled in the guest at runtime.

Currently, the following hstateen bits are supported to control the access
from VS mode.

1. BIT(58): IMSIC     : STOPEI and IMSIC guest interrupt file
2. BIT(59): AIA       : SIPH/SIEH/STOPI
3. BIT(60): AIA_ISEL  : Indirect csr access via siselect/sireg
4. BIT(62): HSENVCFG  : SENVCFG access
5. BIT(63): SSTATEEN0 : SSTATEEN0 access

KVM already support trap/enabling of BIT(58) and BIT(60) in order
to support sw version of the guest interrupt file. This series extends
those to enable to correpsonding hstateen bits in PATCH1. The remaining
patches adds lazy enabling support of the other bits.

I am working on a followup series to add indirect CSR extension and move the
siselect/sireg handlers out of AIA so that other features(e.g CTR) can leverage
it.

Note: This series just updates the hstateen bit in cfg so that any update
would reflect in the correct VM state during the next vcpu load.
Alternatively, we can save the hstateen state in vcpu_put to achieve this.
However, it will incur additional cost on every VM exit while the current
approach just updates the configuration once per VM life time upon first
access.

[PATCH 1/5] RISC-V: KVM: Lazy enable hstateen IMSIC & ISEL bit
Author: Atish Patra <atishp@rivosinc.com>

Currently, we enable the smstateen bit at vcpu configure time by
only checking the presence of required ISA extensions.

These bits are not required to be enabled if the guest never uses
the corresponding architectural state. Enable the smstaeen bits
at runtime lazily upon first access.

New:  KVM: arm64: VM exit to userspace to handle SEA
[PATCH v1 1/6] KVM: arm64: VM exit to userspace to handle SEA
Author: Jiaqi Yan <jiaqiyan@google.com>

When APEI fails to handle a stage2 abort that is synchrnous external
abort (SEA), today KVM directly injects an async SError to the VCPU
then resumes it, which usually results in unpleasant guest kernel panic.

One major situation of guest SEA is when vCPU consumes recoverable
uncorrected memory error (UER). Although SError and guest kernel panic
effectively stops the propagation of corrupted memory, there is still
room to recover from memory UER in a more graceful manner.

Alternatively KVM can redirect the synchronous SEA event to VMM to
- Reduce blast radius if possible. VMM can inject a SEA to VCPU via
  KVM's existing KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS API. If the memory poison
  consumption or fault is not from guest kernel, blast radius can be
  limited to the triggering thread in guest userspace, so VM can
  keep running.
- VMM can protect from future memory poison consumption by unmapping
  the page from stage-2 with KVM userfault [1]. VMM can also
  track SEA events that VM customer cares about, restart VM when
  certain number of distinct poison events happened, provide
  observability to customers [2].

Introduce following userspace-visible features to make VMM handle SEA:
- KVM_CAP_ARM_SEA_TO_USER. As the alternative fallback behavior
  when host APEI fails to claim a SEA, userspace can opt in this new
  capability to let KVM exit to userspace during synchronous abort.
- KVM_EXIT_ARM_SEA. A new exit reason is introduced for this, and
  KVM fills kvm_run.arm_sea with as much as possible information about
  the SEA, including
  - ESR_EL2.
  - If faulting guest virtual and physical addresses are available.
  - Faulting guest virtual address if available.
  - Faulting guest physical address if available.

New:  VMM can handle guest SEA via KVM_EXIT_ARM_SEA
[PATCH v1 0/6] VMM can handle guest SEA via KVM_EXIT_ARM_SEA
Author: Jiaqi Yan <jiaqiyan@google.com>

Problem
=======

When host APEI is unable to claim synchronous external abort (SEA)
during stage-2 guest abort, today KVM directly injects an async SError
into the VCPU then resumes it. The injected SError usually results in
unpleasant guest kernel panic.

One of the major situation of guest SEA is when VCPU consumes recoverable
uncorrected memory error (UER), which is not uncommon at all in modern
datacenter servers with large amounts of physical memory. Although SError
and guest panic is sufficient to stop the propagation of corrupted memory
there is still room to recover from memory UER in a more graceful manner.

Proposed Solution
=================

Alternatively KVM can replay the SEA to the faulting VCPU, via existing
KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS API. If the memory poison consumption or the fault
that cause SEA is not from guest kernel, the blast radius can be limited
to the consuming or faulting guest userspace process, so the VM can keep
running.

In addition, instead of doing under the hood without involving userspace,
there are benefits to redirect the SEA to VMM:

- VM customers care about the disruptions caused by memory errors, and
  VMM usually has the responsibility to start the process of notifying
  the customers of memory error events in their VMs. For example some
  cloud provider emits a critical log in their observability UI [1], and
  provides playbook for customers on how to mitigate disruptions to
  their workloads.

- VMM can protect future memory error consumption or faults by unmapping
  the poisoned pages from stage-2 page table with KVM userfault [2],
  which is more performant than splitting the memslot that contains
  the poisoned guest pages.

- VMM can keep track SEA events in the VM. When VMM thinks the status
  on the host or the VM is bad enough, e.g. number of distinct SEAs
  exceeds a threshold, it can restart the VM on another healthy host.

- Behavior parity with x86 architecture. When machine check exception
  (MCE) is caused by VCPU, kernel or KVM signals userspace SIGBUS to
  let VMM either recover from the MCE, or terminate itself with VM.
  The prior RFC proposes to implement SIGBUS on arm64 as well, but
  Marc preferred VCPU exit over signal [3]. However, implementation
  aside, returning SEA to VMM is on par with returning MCE to VMM.

Once SEA is redirected to VMM, among other actions, VMM is encouraged
to inject external aborts into the faulting VCPU, which is already
supported by KVM on arm64, although not fully supported by
KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS but complemented in this patchset.

New UAPIs
=========

This patchset introduces following userspace-visiable changes to empower
VMM to control what happens next for guest SEA:

- KVM_CAP_ARM_SEA_TO_USER. If userspace enables this new capability at VM
  creation, KVM will not inject SError while taking SEA, but VM exit to
  userspace.

- KVM_EXIT_ARM_SEA. This is the VM exit reason VMM gets. The details
  about the SEA is provided in arm_sea as much as possible, including
  ESR value at EL2, if guest virtual and physical addresses (GPA and GVA)
  are available and the values if available.

- KVM_CAP_ARM_INJECT_EXT_IABT. VMM today can inject external data abort
  to VCPU via KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS API. However, in case of instruction
  abort, VMM cannot inject it via KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS.
  KVM_CAP_ARM_INJECT_EXT_IABT is just a natural extend to
  KVM_CAP_ARM_INJECT_EXT_DABT that tells VMM KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS now
  supports external instruction abort.

Patchset utilizes commit 26fbdf369227 ("KVM: arm64: Don't translate
FAR if invalid/unsafe") from [4], available already in kvmarm/next.
[4] makes KVM safely do address translation for HPFAR_EL2, including at
the event of SEA, and indicate if HPFAR_EL2 is valid in NS bit.
This patchset depends on [4] to tell userspace if GPA is valid and
its value if valid.

Patchset is based on commit 68ec8b4e84446 ("Merge branch
kvm-arm64/pkvm-6.16 into kvmarm-master/next")

New:  PCI/P2PDMA: Refactor the p2pdma mapping helpers
[PATCH v11 1/9] PCI/P2PDMA: Refactor the p2pdma mapping helpers
Author: Leon Romanovsky <leon@kernel.org>


The current scheme with a single helper to determine the P2P status
and map a scatterlist segment force users to always use the map_sg
helper to DMA map, which we're trying to get away from because they
are very cache inefficient.

Refactor the code so that there is a single helper that checks the P2P
state for a page, including the result that it is not a P2P page to
simplify the callers, and a second one to perform the address translation
for a bus mapped P2P transfer that does not depend on the scatterlist
structure.

 LWN coverage:
Dancing the DMA two-step - https://lwn.net/Articles/997563/
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently the only efficient way to map a complex memory description through
the DMA API is by using the scatterlist APIs. The SG APIs are unique in that
they efficiently combine the two fundamental operations of sizing and allocating
a large IOVA window from the IOMMU and processing all the per-address
swiotlb/flushing/p2p/map details.

This uniqueness has been a long standing pain point as the scatterlist API
is mandatory, but expensive to use. It prevents any kind of optimization or
feature improvement (such as avoiding struct page for P2P) due to the
impossibility of improving the scatterlist.

Several approaches have been explored to expand the DMA API with additional
scatterlist-like structures (BIO, rlist), instead split up the DMA API
to allow callers to bring their own data structure.

The API is split up into parts:
 - Allocate IOVA space:
    To do any pre-allocation required. This is done based on the caller
    supplying some details about how much IOMMU address space it would need
    in worst case.
 - Map and unmap relevant structures to pre-allocated IOVA space:
    Perform the actual mapping into the pre-allocated IOVA. This is very
    similar to dma_map_page().

The whole series can be found here:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/leon/linux-rdma.git dma-split-May-5
There can be found examples of three different users are converted to the new API
to show the benefits and its versatility. Each user has a unique
flow:
 1. RDMA ODP is an example of "SVA mirroring" using HMM that needs to
    dynamically map/unmap large numbers of single pages. This becomes
    significantly faster in the IOMMU case as the map/unmap is now just
    a page table walk, the IOVA allocation is pre-computed once. Significant
    amounts of memory are saved as there is no longer a need to store the
    dma_addr_t of each page.
 2. VFIO PCI live migration code is building a very large "page list"
    for the device. Instead of allocating a scatter list entry per allocated
    page it can just allocate an array of 'struct page *', saving a large
    amount of memory.
 3. NVMe PCI demonstrates how a BIO can be converted to a HW scatter
    list without having to allocate then populate an intermediate SG table.

To make the use of the new API easier, HMM and block subsystems are extended
to hide the optimization details from the caller. Among these optimizations:
 * Memory reduction as in most real use cases there is no need to store mapped
   DMA addresses and unmap them.
 * Reducing the function call overhead by removing the need to call function
   pointers and use direct calls instead.

This step is first along a path to provide alternatives to scatterlist and
solve some of the abuses and design mistakes.

Thanks

New:  single-binary: compile target/arm twice
[PATCH v5 00/48] single-binary: compile target/arm twice
Author: Pierrick Bouvier <pierrick.bouvier@linaro.org>

More work toward single-binary.

Some files have external dependencies for the single-binary:
- target/arm/gdbstub.c: gdbhelpers
- target/arm/arm-qmp-cmds.c: qapi
- target/arm/tcg/translate*: need deep cleanup in include/tcg
- target/arm/tcg/cpu*: need TargetInfo implemented for arm/aarch64
- target/arm/tcg/*-helper*: need deeper split between aarch64 and arm code
They will not be ported in this series.

Built on {linux, windows, macos} x {x86_64, aarch64}
Fully tested on linux-x86_64
