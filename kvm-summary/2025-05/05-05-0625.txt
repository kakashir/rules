New:  single-binary: compile target/arm twice
[PATCH v4 00/40] single-binary: compile target/arm twice
Author: Pierrick Bouvier <pierrick.bouvier@linaro.org>

More work toward single-binary.

Some files have external dependencies for the single-binary:
- target/arm/gdbstub.c: gdbhelpers
- target/arm/arm-qmp-cmds.c: qapi
They will not be ported in this series.

Built on {linux, windows, macos} x {x86_64, aarch64}
Fully tested on linux-x86_64

v1
--

- target/arm/cpu.c

v2
--

- Remove duplication of kvm struct and constant (Alex)
- Use target_big_endian() (Anton)

v3
--

CI: https://github.com/pbo-linaro/qemu/actions/runs/14765763846/job/41456754153
- Add missing license for new files (Richard)
- target/arm/debug_helper.c

- add patch to apply target config for picking files in libsystem/libuser
  Useful for Philippe series for semihosting:

- update some patches description (Philippe & Richard)
- tcg: introduce vaddr type (Richard)
- modify concerned helpers to use vaddr instead of i64 (Richard)
- use int64_t instead of uint64_t for top_bits in ptw.c (Philippe)
- arm_casq_ptw: use CONFIG_ATOMIC64 instead of TARGET_AARCH64 and comment why
  (Richard)
- target/arm/machine.c
