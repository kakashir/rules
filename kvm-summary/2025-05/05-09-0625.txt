New:  target/i386: Update EPYC CPU model for Cache property, RAS, SVM feature bits
[PATCH v7 1/6] target/i386: Update EPYC CPU model for Cache property, RAS, SVM feature bits
Author: Babu Moger <babu.moger@amd.com>

Found that some of the cache properties are not set correctly for EPYC models.

l1d_cache.no_invd_sharing should not be true.
l1i_cache.no_invd_sharing should not be true.

L2.self_init should be true.
L2.inclusive should be true.

L3.inclusive should not be true.
L3.no_invd_sharing should be true.

Fix the cache properties.

Also add the missing RAS and SVM features bits on AMD
EPYC CPU models. The SVM feature bits are used in nested guests.

Author: James Houghton <jthoughton@google.com>


Extract the guts of thp_configured() and get_trans_hugepagesz() to
standalone helpers so that the core logic can be reused for other sysfs
files, e.g. to query numa_balancing.

Opportunistically assert that the initial fscanf() read at least one byte,
and add a comment explaining the second call to fscanf().

New:  KVM: selftests: access_tracking_perf_test fixes for
[PATCH v4 0/7] KVM: selftests: access_tracking_perf_test fixes for
Author: James Houghton <jthoughton@google.com>

This series fixes some issues with access_tracking_perf_test when MGLRU
or NUMA balancing are in use.

With MGLRU, touching a page doesn't necessarily clear the Idle flag.
This has come up in the past, and the recommendation was to use MGLRU
generation numbers[1], which this series does.

With NUMA balancing, pages are temporarily mapped as PROT_NONE, so the
SPTEs will be zapped, losing the Accessed bits. The fix here is, in the
event we have lost access information to print a warning and continue
with the test, just like what we do if the test is running a nested VM.

A flag is added for the user to specify if they wish for the test to
always enforce or always skip this check.

Based on kvm/next.

Changelog:

v3[4] -> v4:
- Multiple fixes to access_tracking_perf_test:
  1. Fix for software-managed A/D-bit configs.
  2. Fix for expected number of pages when guest page size is >
     PAGE_SIZE.
  3. Properly check youngest generation when looking for pages.
- Do an initial aging pass for MGLRU. This allows us to check that pages
  move back to the youngest generation after the first access pass.
- Add controller-root location logic in the cgroup utils, and use this
  to make the test work for cgroup-v1 (thanks Sean!).
- Some cleanup for access_tracking_perf_test code, comments, warning
  messages, and the commit message (thanks Sean!).

v2[3] -> v3:
- Applied David's directory fix on patch 3.
- Added SoB-by, R-by (patch 2, missed in v2), and A-by.

v1[2] -> v2:
- Re-add clone3_selftests.h for cgroup selftests (thanks Michal!)
- Some comment fixes, patches 2 and 5 (thanks Maxim!).

New:  QEMU TDX support
[PATCH v9 00/55] QEMU TDX support
Author: Xiaoyao Li <xiaoyao.li@intel.com>

This is the v9 series of TDX QEMU enabling. The series is also available
at github:
https://github.com/intel-staging/qemu-tdx/tree/tdx-qemu-upstream-v9

Note, this series has a dependency on
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20241217123932.948789-1-xiaoyao.li@intel.com/

=============
Changes in v9

Comparing to v8, no big change in v9.

V9 mainly collects Reviewed-by tags from Daniel and Zhao Liu (Thanks to
their review!) and v9 does some small change according to the review
feedback of them. Please see the individual patch for the detailed
change history.

===========
future work

- CPU model

  It now only supports booting TD VM with "-cpu host". It is the only
  case that is not supposed to hit any warning/error.

  When using named CPU model, even the same model as host, it likely
  hits warning like some feature not supported or some feature enforced
  on. It's a future work to decide if needs to introduce TDX specific
  named CPU models.

- Attestation support

  Atttestation support will be submitted separately since it depends on
  the GHCI clarification on the format of the `datai` filed of the
  shared buffer of <GetQuote>.[1]

- gdb support

  gdb support to debug a TD in off-debug mode is left as future work.

New:  VCPU reset fixes
[PATCH v2 0/2] VCPU reset fixes
Author: Radim Krčmář <rkrcmar@ventanamicro.com>

Hello,

v2 abandons the idea of fixing current userspaces and adds a new
capability that uses MP_STATE to immediately trigger a KVM VCPU reset --
a single-purpose interface free of any unintended side effects is
desirable and MP_STATE is somewhat bendable, which avoids the need for a
new IOCTL.  It's very dirty, though, so I'm not happy with it.

I have prepared a preview QEMU implementation [1] and only did light
testing with kvm-unit-tests as I still expect a high-level discussion.

Because it didn't take much effort on top, v2 expands the goals --
userspace can now choose the same post-reset state for all VCPUs.
(This is achieved by returning from userspace on sbi_hart_stop; let me
 know if I should rather do that with another KVM capability.)

This series does not fully address the VCPU hot-unplug.
We still need a better KVM interface there, because the VCPU stopped by
sbi_hart_stop is still assumed to be present by sbi_hart_start.

I see roughly two options, with different drawbacks:
* add a new MP_STATE for the SBI HSM acceleration in KVM
* return to userspace even on sbi_hart_start and sbi_hart_get_status

(We might want to have a better interface for handing SBI in userspace
 anyway, so that could be handled later.)

v2 is based on kvm-riscv/riscv_kvm_queue, 376e3c0f8aa5 ("KVM: RISC-V:
remove unnecessary SBI reset state").

Most of the patches from v1 got merged, thanks Anup, so v2 only contains
the completely redesigned approach [2/2] and a minor code style
improvement that fell through the cracks when the patches got merged out
of order [1/2].

New:  KVM: Bound the number of dirty ring entries in a
[PATCH v2 1/5] KVM: Bound the number of dirty ring entries in a
Author: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

Cap the number of ring entries that are reset in a single ioctl to INT_MAX
to ensure userspace isn't confused by a wrap into negative space, and so
that, in a truly pathological scenario, KVM doesn't miss a TLB flush due
to the count wrapping to zero.  While the size of the ring is fixed at
0x10000 entries and KVM (currently) supports at most 4096, userspace is
allowed to harvest entries from the ring while the reset is in-progress,
i.e. it's possible for the ring to always have harvested entries.

Opportunistically return an actual error code from the helper so that a
future fix to handle pending signals can gracefully return -EINTR.

New:  KVM: Dirty ring fixes and cleanups
[PATCH v2 0/5] KVM: Dirty ring fixes and cleanups
Author: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

Fix issues with dirty ring harvesting where KVM doesn't bound the processing
of entries in any way, which allows userspace to keep KVM in a tight loop
indefinitely.

E.g.

        struct kvm_dirty_gfn *dirty_gfns = vcpu_map_dirty_ring(vcpu);

        if (fork()) {
                int r;

                for (;;) {
                        r = kvm_vm_reset_dirty_ring(vcpu->vm);
                        if (r)
                                printf("RESET %d dirty ring entries\n", r);
                }
        } else {
                int i;

                for (i = 0; i < test_dirty_ring_count; i++) {
                        dirty_gfns[i].slot = TEST_MEM_SLOT_INDEX;
                        dirty_gfns[i].offset = (i * 64) % host_num_pages;
                }

                for (;;) {
                        for (i = 0; i < test_dirty_ring_count; i++)
                                WRITE_ONCE(dirty_gfns[i].flags, KVM_DIRTY_GFN_F_RESET);
                }
        }

Patches 1-3 address that class of bugs.  Patches 4 and 5 are cleanups.

  patchset is exactly the same as v2

Changes in v2:
- Rebase on top of 6.15-rc5
- Add RB tags

====

Addressed comments following conversations with Pavel, Stan, and
Harshitha. Thank you guys for the reviews again. Overall minor changes:

Changelog:
- Check for !niov->pp in io_zcrx_recv_frag, just in case we end up with
  a TX niov in that path (Pavel).
- Fix locking case in !netif_device_present (Jakub/Stan).

v9: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20250415224756.152002-1-almasrymina@google.com/
===

Changelog:
- Use priv->bindings list instead of sock_bindings_list. This was missed
  during the rebase as the bindings have been updated to use
  priv->bindings recently (thanks Stan!)

v8: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20250308214045.1160445-1-almasrymina@google.com/
===

Only address minor comments on V7

Changelog:
- Use netdev locking instead of rtnl_locking to match rx path.
- Now that iouring zcrx is in net-next, use NET_IOV_IOURING instead of
  NET_IOV_UNSPECIFIED.
- Post send binding to net_devmem_dmabuf_bindings after it's been fully
  initialized (Stan).

v7: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20250227041209.2031104-1-almasrymina@google.com/
===

Changelog:
- Check the dmabuf net_iov binding belongs to the device the TX is going
  out on. (Jakub)
- Provide detailed inspection of callsites of
  __skb_frag_ref/skb_page_unref in patch 2's changelog (Jakub)

v6: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20250222191517.743530-1-almasrymina@google.com/
===

v6 has no major changes. Addressed a few issues from Paolo and David,
and collected Acks from Stan. Thank you everyone for the review!

Changes:
- retain behavior to process MSG_FASTOPEN even if the provided cmsg is
  invalid (Paolo).
- Rework the freeing of tx_vec slightly (it now has its own err label).
  (Paolo).
- Squash the commit that makes dmabuf unbinding scheduled work into the
  same one which implements the TX path so we don't run into future
  errors on bisecting (Paolo).
- Fix/add comments to explain how dmabuf binding refcounting works
  (David).

v5: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20250220020914.895431-1-almasrymina@google.com/
===

v5 has no major changes; it clears up the relatively minor issues
pointed out to in v4, and rebases the series on top of net-next to
resolve the conflict with a patch that raced to the tree. It also
collects the review tags from v4.

Changes:
- Rebase to net-next
- Fix issues in selftest (Stan).
- Address comments in the devmem and netmem driver docs (Stan and Bagas)
- Fix zerocopy_fill_skb_from_devmem return error code (Stan).

v4: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20250203223916.1064540-1-almasrymina@google.com/
===

v4 mainly addresses the critical driver support issue surfaced in v3 by
Paolo and Stan. Drivers aiming to support netmem_tx should make sure not
to pass the netmem dma-addrs to the dma-mapping APIs, as these dma-addrs
may come from dma-bufs.

Additionally other feedback from v3 is addressed.

Major changes:
- Add helpers to handle netmem dma-addrs. Add GVE support for
  netmem_tx.
- Fix binding->tx_vec not being freed on error paths during the
  tx binding.
- Add a minimal devmem_tx test to devmem.py.
- Clean up everything obsolete from the cover letter (Paolo).

v3: https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/netdevbpf/list/?series=929401&state=*
===

Address minor comments from RFCv2 and fix a few build warnings and
ynl-regen issues. No major changes.

RFC v2: https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/netdevbpf/list/?series=920056&state=*
=======

RFC v2 addresses much of the feedback from RFC v1. I plan on sending
something close to this as net-next  reopens, sending it slightly early
to get feedback if any.

Major changes:
--------------

- much improved UAPI as suggested by Stan. We now interpret the iov_base
  of the passed in iov from userspace as the offset into the dmabuf to
  send from. This removes the need to set iov.iov_base = NULL which may
  be confusing to users, and enables us to send multiple iovs in the
  same sendmsg() call. ncdevmem and the docs show a sample use of that.

- Removed the duplicate dmabuf iov_iter in binding->iov_iter. I think
  this is good improvment as it was confusing to keep track of
  2 iterators for the same sendmsg, and mistracking both iterators
  caused a couple of bugs reported in the last iteration that are now
  resolved with this streamlining.

- Improved test coverage in ncdevmem. Now multiple sendmsg() are tested,
  and sending multiple iovs in the same sendmsg() is tested.

- Fixed issue where dmabuf unmapping was happening in invalid context
  (Stan).

====================================================================

The TX path had been dropped from the Device Memory TCP patch series
post RFCv1 [1], to make that series slightly easier to review. This
series rebases the implementation of the TX path on top of the
net_iov/netmem framework agreed upon and merged. The motivation for
the feature is thoroughly described in the docs & cover letter of the
original proposal, so I don't repeat the lengthy descriptions here, but
they are available in [1].

Full outline on usage of the TX path is detailed in the documentation
included with this series.

Test example is available via the kselftest included in the series as well.

The series is relatively small, as the TX path for this feature largely
piggybacks on the existing MSG_ZEROCOPY implementation.

Patch Overview:
---------------

1. Documentation & tests to give high level overview of the feature
   being added.

1. Add netmem refcounting needed for the TX path.

2. Devmem TX netlink API.

3. Devmem TX net stack implementation.

4. Make dma-buf unbinding scheduled work to handle TX cases where it gets
   freed from contexts where we can't sleep.

5. Add devmem TX documentation.

6. Add scaffolding enabling driver support for netmem_tx. Add helpers, driver
feature flag, and docs to enable drivers to declare netmem_tx support.

7. Guard netmem_tx against being enabled against drivers that don't
   support it.

8. Add devmem_tx selftests. Add TX path to ncdevmem and add a test to
   devmem.py.

Testing:
--------

Testing is very similar to devmem TCP RX path. The ncdevmem test used
for the RX path is now augemented with client functionality to test TX
path.

* Test Setup:

Kernel: net-next with this RFC and memory provider API cherry-picked
locally.

Hardware: Google Cloud A3 VMs.

NIC: GVE with header split & RSS & flow steering support.

Performance results are not included with this version, unfortunately.
I'm having issues running the dma-buf exporter driver against the
upstream kernel on my test setup. The issues are specific to that
dma-buf exporter and do not affect this patch series. I plan to follow
up this series with perf fixes if the tests point to issues once they're
up and running.

Special thanks to Stan who took a stab at rebasing the TX implementation
on top of the netmem/net_iov framework merged. Parts of his proposal [2]
that are reused as-is are forked off into their own patches to give full
credit.

New:  single-binary: compile target/arm twice
[PATCH v7 00/49] single-binary: compile target/arm twice
Author: Pierrick Bouvier <pierrick.bouvier@linaro.org>

More work toward single-binary.

Some files have external dependencies for the single-binary:
- target/arm/gdbstub.c: gdbhelpers
- target/arm/arm-qmp-cmds.c: qapi
- target/arm/tcg/translate*: need deep cleanup in include/tcg
- target/arm/tcg/cpu*: need TargetInfo implemented for arm/aarch64
- target/arm/tcg/*-helper*: need deeper split between aarch64 and arm code
They will not be ported in this series.

Built on {linux, windows, macos} x {x86_64, aarch64}
Fully tested on linux x {x86_64, aarch64}

Series is now tested and fully reviewed. Thanks for pulling it.
