New:  KVM: arm64: Revamp Fine Grained Trap handling
[PATCH v4 00/43] KVM: arm64: Revamp Fine Grained Trap handling
Author: Marc Zyngier <maz@kernel.org>

This is yet another version of the series last posted at [1].

The eagled eye reviewer will have noticed that since v2, the series
has more or less doubled in size for any reasonable metric (number of
patches, number of lines added or deleted). It is therefore pretty
urgent that this gets either merged or forgotten! ;-)

See the change log below for the details -- most of it is related to
FGT2 (and its rather large dependencies) being added.

* From v3:

  - Added missing bit fields for CPACR_EL1

  - Fixed a bunch of typos in comments and commit messages

  - Cleaned-up whitespace damage from the sysreg generator

  - Collected RBs from Joey, with thanks!

* From v2:

  - Added comprehensive support for FEAT_FGT2, as the host kernel is
    now making use of these registers, without any form of context
    switch in KVM. What could possibly go wrong?

  - Reworked some of the FGT description and handling primitives,
    reducing the boilerplate code and tables that get added over time.

  - Rebased on 6.15-rc3.

New:  x86/fpu/xstate: Always preserve non-user xfeatures/flags in __state_perm
[PATCH v6 1/7] x86/fpu/xstate: Always preserve non-user xfeatures/flags in __state_perm
Author: Chao Gao <chao.gao@intel.com>


When granting userspace or a KVM guest access to an xfeature, preserve the
entity's existing supervisor and software-defined permissions as tracked
by __state_perm, i.e. use __state_perm to track *all* permissions even
though all supported supervisor xfeatures are granted to all FPUs and
FPU_GUEST_PERM_LOCKED disallows changing permissions.

Effectively clobbering supervisor permissions results in inconsistent
behavior, as xstate_get_group_perm() will report supervisor features for
process that do NOT request access to dynamic user xfeatures, whereas any
and all supervisor features will be absent from the set of permissions for
any process that is granted access to one or more dynamic xfeatures (which
right now means AMX).

The inconsistency isn't problematic because fpu_xstate_prctl() already
strips out everything except user xfeatures:

        case ARCH_GET_XCOMP_PERM:
                /*
                 * Lockless snapshot as it can also change right after the
                 * dropping the lock.
                 */
                permitted = xstate_get_host_group_perm();
                permitted &= XFEATURE_MASK_USER_SUPPORTED;
                return put_user(permitted, uptr);

        case ARCH_GET_XCOMP_GUEST_PERM:
                permitted = xstate_get_guest_group_perm();
                permitted &= XFEATURE_MASK_USER_SUPPORTED;
                return put_user(permitted, uptr);

and similarly KVM doesn't apply the __state_perm to supervisor states
(kvm_get_filtered_xcr0() incorporates xstate_get_guest_group_perm()):

        case 0xd: {
                u64 permitted_xcr0 = kvm_get_filtered_xcr0();
                u64 permitted_xss = kvm_caps.supported_xss;

But if KVM in particular were to ever change, dropping supervisor
permissions would result in subtle bugs in KVM's reporting of supported
CPUID settings.  And the above behavior also means that having supervisor
xfeatures in __state_perm is correctly handled by all users.

Dropping supervisor permissions also creates another landmine for KVM.  If
more dynamic user xfeatures are ever added, requesting access to multiple
xfeatures in separate ARCH_REQ_XCOMP_GUEST_PERM calls will result in the
second invocation of __xstate_request_perm() computing the wrong ksize, as
as the mask passed to xstate_calculate_size() would not contain *any*
supervisor features.

Commit 781c64bfcb73 ("x86/fpu/xstate: Handle supervisor states in XSTATE
permissions") fudged around the size issue for userspace FPUs, but for
reasons unknown skipped guest FPUs.  Lack of a fix for KVM "works" only
because KVM doesn't yet support virtualizing features that have supervisor
xfeatures, i.e. as of today, KVM guest FPUs will never need the relevant
xfeatures.

Simply extending the hack-a-fix for guests would temporarily solve the
ksize issue, but wouldn't address the inconsistency issue and would leave
another lurking pitfall for KVM.  KVM support for virtualizing CET will
likely add CET_KERNEL as a guest-only xfeature, i.e. CET_KERNEL will not
be set in xfeatures_mask_supervisor() and would again be dropped when
granting access to dynamic xfeatures.

Note, the existing clobbering behavior is rather subtle.  The @permitted
parameter to __xstate_request_perm() comes from:

	permitted = xstate_get_group_perm(guest);

which is either fpu->guest_perm.__state_perm or fpu->perm.__state_perm,
where __state_perm is initialized to:

        fpu->perm.__state_perm          = fpu_kernel_cfg.default_features;

and copied to the guest side of things:

	/* Same defaults for guests */
	fpu->guest_perm = fpu->perm;

fpu_kernel_cfg.default_features contains everything except the dynamic
xfeatures, i.e. everything except XFEATURE_MASK_XTILE_DATA:

        fpu_kernel_cfg.default_features = fpu_kernel_cfg.max_features;
        fpu_kernel_cfg.default_features &= ~XFEATURE_MASK_USER_DYNAMIC;

When __xstate_request_perm() restricts the local "mask" variable to
compute the user state size:

	mask &= XFEATURE_MASK_USER_SUPPORTED;
	usize = xstate_calculate_size(mask, false);

it subtly overwrites the target __state_perm with "mask" containing only
user xfeatures:

	perm = guest ? &fpu->guest_perm : &fpu->perm;
	/* Pairs with the READ_ONCE() in xstate_get_group_perm() */
	WRITE_ONCE(perm->__state_perm, mask);

New:  Introduce CET supervisor state support
[PATCH v6 0/7] Introduce CET supervisor state support
Author: Chao Gao <chao.gao@intel.com>

Dear maintainers and reviewers,

I kindly request your consideration for merging this series. The changes
between v5 (posted one month ago) and v6 are minimal, and most of the
patches have received Reviewed-by/Acked-by tags.

Thanks Chang, Rick, Xin and Sean for their help with this series.

== Changelog ==
v5->v6:
 - Collect reviews from Chang and Rick
 - Reset guest default size to FPU legacy size when XSAVE is not available
   or not enabled (Chang)
 - Drop guest default user features and size, as they will not differ from
   host FPUs (Rick)
 - v5: https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20250410072605.2358393-1-chao.gao@intel.com/

== Background ==

CET defines two register states: CET user, which includes user-mode control
registers, and CET supervisor, which consists of shadow-stack pointers for
privilege levels 0-2.

Current kernels disable shadow stacks in kernel mode, making the CET
supervisor state unused and eliminating the need for context switching.

== Problem ==

To virtualize CET for guests, KVM must accurately emulate hardware
behavior. A key challenge arises because there is no CPUID flag to indicate
that shadow stack is supported only in user mode. Therefore, KVM cannot
assume guests will not enable shadow stacks in kernel mode and must
preserve the CET supervisor state of vCPUs.

== Solution ==

An initial proposal to manually save and restore CET supervisor states
using raw RDMSR/WRMSR in KVM was rejected due to performance concerns and
its impact on KVM's ABI. Instead, leveraging the kernel's FPU
infrastructure for context switching was favored [1].

The main question then became whether to enable the CET supervisor state
globally for all processes or restrict it to vCPU processes. This decision
involves a trade-off between a 24-byte XSTATE buffer waste for all non-vCPU
processes and approximately 100 lines of code complexity in the kernel [2].
The agreed approach is to first try this optimal solution [3], i.e.,
restricting the CET supervisor state to guest FPUs only and eliminating
unnecessary space waste.

Key changes in this series are:

1) Fix existing issue regarding enabling guest supervisor states support.
2) Add default features and size for guest FPUs.
3) Add infrastructure to support guest-only features.
4) Add CET supervisor state as the first guest-only feature.

With the series in place, guest FPUs have xstate_bv[12] == xcomp_bv[12] == 1
and CET supervisor state is saved/reloaded when xsaves/xrstors executes on
guest FPUs. non-guest FPUs have xstate_bv[12] == xcomp_bv[12] == 0, then
CET supervisor state is not saved/restored.

== Performance ==

We measured context-switching performance with the benchmark [4] in following
three cases.

case 1: the baseline. i.e., this series isn't applied
case 2: baseline + this series. CET-S space is allocated for guest fpu only.
case 3: baseline + allocate CET-S space for all tasks. Hardware init
        optimization avoids writing out CET-S space on each XSAVES.

The performance differences in the three cases are very small and fall within the
run-to-run variation.

New:  x86/msr: let paravirt inline rdmsr/wrmsr instructions
[PATCH 0/6] x86/msr: let paravirt inline rdmsr/wrmsr instructions
Author: Juergen Gross <jgross@suse.com>

When building a kernel with CONFIG_PARAVIRT_XXL the paravirt
infrastructure will always use functions for reading or writing MSRs,
even when running on bare metal.

Switch to inline RDMSR/WRMSR instructions in this case, reducing the
paravirt overhead.

In order to make this less intrusive, some further reorganization of
the MSR access helpers is done in the first 4 patches.

This series has been tested to work with Xen PV and on bare metal.

There has been another approach by Xin Li, which used dedicated #ifdef
and removing the MSR related paravirt hooks instead of just modifying
the paravirt code generation.

Please note that I haven't included the use of WRMSRNS or the
immediate forms of WRMSR and RDMSR, because I wanted to get some
feedback on my approach first. Enhancing paravirt for those cases
is not very complicated, as the main base is already prepared for
that enhancement.

This series is based on the x86/msr branch of the tip tree.

New:  KVM: selftests: Add a test for x86's fastops emulation
[PATCH] KVM: selftests: Add a test for x86's fastops emulation
Author: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

Add a test to verify KVM's fastops emulation via forced emulation.  KVM's
so called "fastop" infrastructure executes the to-be-emulated instruction
directly on hardware instead of manually emulating the instruction in
software, using various shenanigans to glue together the emulator context
and CPU state, e.g. to get RFLAGS fed into the instruction and back out
for the emulator.

Add testcases for all instructions that are low hanging fruit.  While the
primary goal of the selftest is to validate the glue code, a secondary
goal is to ensure "emulation" matches hardware exactly, including for
arithmetic flags that are architecturally undefined.  While arithmetic
flags may be *architecturally* undefined, their behavior is deterministic
for a given CPU (likely a given uarch, and possibly even an entire family
or class of CPUs).  I.e. KVM has effectively been emulating underlying
hardware behavior for years.
