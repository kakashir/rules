New:  s390: Remove unneeded includes
[PATCH v5 1/4] s390: Remove unneeded includes
Author: Claudio Imbrenda <imbrenda@linux.ibm.com>

Many files don't need to include asm/tlb.h or asm/gmap.h.
On the other hand, asm/tlb.h does need to include asm/gmap.h.

Remove all unneeded includes so that asm/tlb.h is not directly used by
s390 arch code anymore. Remove asm/gmap.h from a few other files as
well, so that now only KVM code, mm/gmap.c, and asm/tlb.h include it.

New:  KVM: s390: Some cleanup and small fixes
[PATCH v5 0/4] KVM: s390: Some cleanup and small fixes
Author: Claudio Imbrenda <imbrenda@linux.ibm.com>

This series has some cleanups and small fixes in preparation of the
upcoming series that will finally completely move all guest page table
handling into kvm. The cleaups and fixes in this series are good enough
on their own, hence why they are being sent now.

v4->v5
* add missing #include <linux/swap.h> to mm/gmap_helpers.c (thanks
  kernel test robot)
* fix diag_release_pages(), I had accidentally removed the guest
  absolute to qemu virtual address translation
* fix patch subject lines (thanks Heiko)

v3->v4
* remove orphaned find_zeropage_ops and find_zeropage_pte_entry() from
  mm/gmap.c (thanks kernel test robot)
* add missing #include <linux/swapops.h> to mm/gmap_helpers.c (thanks
  kernel test robot)

v2->v3  (mainly addresses Nina's and Heiko's comments)
* drop patch 3 - it was just an attempt to clean up the code a little
  and make it more readable, but there were too many issues to address
* remove all dead code from s390/mm/gmap.c that is being replaced by
  code in s390/mm/gmap_helpers.c
* remove a couple of unused functions from s390/mm/gmap_helpers.c, some
  of them will be introduced again in a later series when they are
  actually needed
* added documentation to the functions in s390/mm/gmap_helpers.c
* general readability improvements

v1->v2
* remove uneeded "gmap.h" include from gaccess.c (thanks Christph)
* use a custom helper instead of u64_replace_bits() (thanks Nina)
* new helper functions in priv.c to increase readability (thanks Nina)
* add lockdep assertion in handle_essa() (thanks Nina)
* gmap_helper_disable_cow_sharing() will not take the mmap lock, and
  must now be called while already holding the mmap lock in write mode

New:  s390x: diag10: Fence tcg and pv environments
[kvm-unit-tests PATCH 1/2] s390x: diag10: Fence tcg and pv environments
Author: Janosch Frank <frankja@linux.ibm.com>

Diag10 isn't supported under either of these environments so let's
make sure that the test bails out accordingly.

New:  s390x: diag10: Fixup
[kvm-unit-tests PATCH 0/2] s390x: diag10: Fixup
Author: Janosch Frank <frankja@linux.ibm.com>

While reviewing Claudio's patch set I found a problem that should've
been caught by the diag10 test but wasn't.

Not only does the test never check the good case but it also doesn't
fence against environments where diag10 is not available. The part
that makes this problematic is the fact that this test only tests priv
and spec PGMs. These PGMs are presented even if no diag10 support is
provided since they are also part of the base diagnose architecture.

The tests currently succeed in TCG emulation and PV, both of which do
not implement this specific diagnose.

Therefore this series fences TCG & PV as well as adding a check if the page has
really been cleared.

New:  rust: add helper for mutex_trylock
[PATCH] rust: add helper for mutex_trylock
Author: Paolo Bonzini <pbonzini@redhat.com>

After commit c5b6ababd21a ("locking/mutex: implement mutex_trylock_nested",
currently in the KVM tree) mutex_trylock() will be a macro when lockdep is
enabled.  Rust therefore needs the corresponding helper.  Just add it and
the rust/bindings/bindings_helpers_generated.rs Makefile rules will do
their thing.

        Ok to apply to the KVM tree?

Single line branches also get braces if the previous branch required
braces.
