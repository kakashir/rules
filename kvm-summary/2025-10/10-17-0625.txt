New:  KVM: VMX: Flush CPU buffers as needed if L1D cache
[PATCH v3 1/4] KVM: VMX: Flush CPU buffers as needed if L1D cache
Author: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

If the L1D flush for L1TF is conditionally enabled, flush CPU buffers to
mitigate MMIO Stale Data as needed if KVM skips the L1D flush, e.g.
because none of the "heavy" paths that trigger an L1D flush were tripped
since the last VM-Enter.

Note, the flaw goes back to the introduction of the MDS mitigation.  The
MDS mitigation was inadvertently fixed by commit 43fb862de8f6 ("KVM/VMX:
Move VERW closer to VMentry for MDS mitigation"), but previous kernels
that flush CPU buffers in vmx_vcpu_enter_exit() are affected.

Fixes: 650b68a0622f ("x86/kvm/vmx: Add MDS protection when L1D Flush is not active")

New:  KVM: VMX: Unify L1D flush for L1TF
[PATCH v3 0/4] KVM: VMX: Unify L1D flush for L1TF
Author: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

Unify the L1D cache flushing done to mitigate L1TF under the per-CPU
variable, as the per-vCPU variable has been superfluous for quite some
time.

Patch 1 fixes a bug (I think it's a bug?) I found when poking around the code.
If L1D flushes are conditional and KVM skips an L1D flush on VM-Enter, then
arguably KVM should flush CPU buffers based on other mitigations.

Patches 2-3 bury the L1TF L1D flushing under CONFIG_CPU_MITIGATIONS, partly
because it's absurd that KVM doesn't honor CONFIG_CPU_MITIGATIONS for that
case, partly because it simplifies unifying the tracking code (helps obviate
the need for a stub).

Patch 4 is Brendan's patch and the main goal of the mini-series.

v3:
 - Put the "raw" variant in KVM, dress it up with KVM's "request" terminology,
   and add a comment explaining why _KVM_ knows its usage doesn't need to
   disable virtualization.
 - Add the prep patches.

v2:
 - https://lore.kernel.org/all/20251015-b4-l1tf-percpu-v2-1-6d7a8d3d40e9@google.com
 - Moved the bit back to irq_stat
 - Fixed DEBUG_PREEMPT issues by adding a _raw variant

New:  KVM: SVM: Initialize per-CPU svm_data at the end of
[PATCH 1/3] KVM: SVM: Initialize per-CPU svm_data at the end of
Author: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

Setup the per-CPU SVM data structures at the very end of hardware setup so
that svm_hardware_unsetup() can be used in svm_hardware_setup() to unwind
AVIC setup (for the GALog notifier).  Alternatively, the error path could
do an explicit, manual unwind, e.g. by adding a helper to free the per-CPU
structures.  But the per-CPU allocations have no interactions or
dependencies, i.e. can comfortably live at the end, and so converting to
a manual unwind would introduce churn and code without providing any
immediate advantage.

New:  KVM: SVM: Unregister GALog notifier on module exit
[PATCH 0/3] KVM: SVM: Unregister GALog notifier on module exit
Author: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

Unregister KVM's GALog notifier when kvm-amd.ko is being unloaded so that
a spurious GALog event, e.g. due to some other bug, doesn't escalate to a
use-after-free.

I deliberately didn't tag this for stable@, as shuffling the setup code
around could easily introduce more problems than it solves, e.g. the patch
might apply cleanly to an older kernel, but blow up at runtime due to the
ordering being wrong.

My thought/plan is to get the fix into 6.18, where avic is first enabled by
default, but not bother getting it into older LTS kernels.

New:  KVM: VMX: Inject #UD if guest tries to execute
[PATCH v2 1/2] KVM: VMX: Inject #UD if guest tries to execute
Author: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

Add VMX exit handlers for SEAMCALL and TDCALL to inject a #UD if a non-TD
guest attempts to execute SEAMCALL or TDCALL.  Neither SEAMCALL nor TDCALL
is gated by any software enablement other than VMXON, and so will generate
a VM-Exit instead of e.g. a native #UD when executed from the guest kernel.

Note!  No unprivileged DoS of the L1 kernel is possible as TDCALL and
SEAMCALL #GP at CPL > 0, and the CPL check is performed prior to the VMX
non-root (VM-Exit) check, i.e. userspace can't crash the VM. And for a
nested guest, KVM forwards unknown exits to L1, i.e. an L2 kernel can
crash itself, but not L1.

Note #2!  The Intel=C2=AE Trust Domain CPU Architectural Extensions spec's
pseudocode shows the CPL > 0 check for SEAMCALL coming _after_ the VM-Exit,
but that appears to be a documentation bug (likely because the CPL > 0
check was incorrectly bundled with other lower-priority #GP checks).
Testing on SPR and EMR shows that the CPL > 0 check is performed before
the VMX non-root check, i.e. SEAMCALL #GPs when executed in usermode.

Note #3!  The aforementioned Trust Domain spec uses confusing pseudocode
that says that SEAMCALL will #UD if executed "inSEAM", but "inSEAM"
specifically means in SEAM Root Mode, i.e. in the TDX-Module.  The long-
form description explicitly states that SEAMCALL generates an exit when
executed in "SEAM VMX non-root operation".  But that's a moot point as the
TDX-Module injects #UD if the guest attempts to execute SEAMCALL, as
documented in the "Unconditionally Blocked Instructions" section of the
TDX-Module base specification.

New:  KVM: VMX: Handle SEAMCALL or TDCALL VM-Exits
[PATCH v2 0/2] KVM: VMX: Handle SEAMCALL or TDCALL VM-Exits
Author: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

Add VM-Exit handlers for SEAMCALL and TDCALL as the instructions are gated
only by VMXON, and so a buggy/misbehaving guest will likely be terminated
(because KVM bails with KVM_INTERNAL_ERROR_UNEXPECTED_EXIT_REASON) if the
guest executes SEAMCALL or TDCALL.

v2:
 - Apply the behavior only to VMX.  KVM can't inject #UDs for TDX, and the
   TDX-Module is supposed to handle SEAMCALL. [Chao]
 - Fix nested exit handling (inverted return). [Xiaoyao]
 - WARN if the TDX-Module punts a SEAMCALL exit to KVM. [Xiaoyao]
 - Fix typos. [Binbin]

New:  WHPX support for Arm
[PATCH v8 00/24] WHPX support for Arm
Author: Mohamed Mediouni <mohamed@unpredictable.fr>

Link to branch: https://github.com/mediouni-m/qemu whpx (tag for this submission: whpx-v8)

Missing features:
- PSCI state sync with Hyper-V
- Interrupt controller save-restore
- SVE register sync

Known bugs:
- reboots when multiple cores are enabled are currently broken
- U-Boot still doesn't work (hangs when trying to parse firmware) but EDK2 does.

Note:

"target/arm/kvm: add constants for new PSCI versions" taken from the mailing list.

"accel/system: Introduce hwaccel_enabled() helper" taken from the mailing list, added here
as part of this series to make it compilable as a whole.

"hw/arm: virt: add GICv2m for the case when ITS is not available" present in both the HVF
vGIC and this series.

And another note:
Seems that unlike HVF there isn't direct correspondence between WHv registers and the actual register layout,
so didn't do changes there to a sysreg.inc.

Updates since v7:
- Oops, fixing bug in "hw/arm: virt: cleanly fail on attempt to use the platform vGIC together with ITS".
Other commits are unchanged.

Updates since v6:
- Rebasing
- Fixing a bug in the GICv3+GICv2m case for ACPI table generation
- getting rid of the slots infrastructure for memory management
- Place the docs commit right after the "cleanly fail on attempt to run GICv3+GICv2m on an unsupported config" one
as that's what switches ITS to a tristate.
- Fixing a build issue when getting rid of the arch-specific arm64 hvf-stub.

Updates since v5:
- Rebasing
- Address review comments
- Rework ITS enablement to a tristate
- On x86: move away from deprecated APIs to get/set APIC state

Updates since v4:
- Taking into account review comments
- Add migration blocker in the vGICv3 code due to missing interrupt controller save/restore
- Debug register sync

Updates since v3:
- Disabling SVE on WHPX
- Taking into account review comments incl:

- fixing x86 support
- reduce the amount of __x86_64__ checks in common code to the minimum (winhvemulation)
which can be reduced even further down the road.
- generalize get_physical_address_range into something common between hvf and whpx

Updates since v2:
- Fixed up a rebase screwup for whpx-internal.h
- Fixed ID_AA64ISAR1_EL1 and ID_AA64ISAR2_EL1 feature probe for -cpu host
- Switched to ID_AA64PFR1_EL1/ID_AA64DFR0_EL1 instead of their non-AA64 variant

Updates since v1:
- Shutdowns and reboots
- MPIDR_EL1 register sync
- Fixing GICD_TYPER_LPIS value
- IPA size clamping
- -cpu host now implemented

New:  KVM: guest_memfd: Rename "struct kvm_gmem" to
[PATCH v13 01/12] KVM: guest_memfd: Rename "struct kvm_gmem" to
Author: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

Rename the "kvm_gmem" structure to "gmem_file" in anticipation of using
dedicated guest_memfd inodes instead of anonyomous inodes, at which point
the "kvm_gmem" nomenclature becomes quite misleading.  In guest_memfd,
inodes are effectively the raw underlying physical storage, and will be
used to track properties of the physical memory, while each gmem file is
effectively a single VM's view of that storage, and is used to track assets
specific to its associated VM, e.g. memslots=>gmem bindings.

Using "kvm_gmem" suggests that the per-VM/per-file structures are _the_
guest_memfd instance, which almost the exact opposite of reality.

Opportunistically rename local variables from "gmem" to "f", again to
avoid confusion once guest_memfd specific inodes come along.

No functional change intended.

New:  KVM: guest_memfd: Add NUMA mempolicy support
[PATCH v13 00/12] KVM: guest_memfd: Add NUMA mempolicy support
Author: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

Miguel, you got pulled in due to a one-line change to add a new iterator
macros in .clang-format.

Shivank's series to add support for NUMA-aware memory placement in
guest_memfd.  Based on kvm-x86/next.

Note, Ackerley pointed out that we should probably have testing for the
cpuset_do_page_mem_spread() behavior.  I 100% agree, but I'm also a-ok
merging without those tests.

v13:
 - Collect reviews.
 - Add kvm_gmem_for_each_file to .clang-format. [Ackerley]
 - Fix typos. [Ackerley]
 - Don't use get_task_policy() if the guest_memfd doesn't have its own
   policy, so that cpuset_do_page_mem_spread() works. [Ackerley]
 - Fix goofs in the changelogs related to numaif.h. [Ackerley]

v12:
 - https://lore.kernel.org/all/20251007221420.344669-1-seanjc@google.com
 - Add missing functionality to KVM selftests' existing numaif.h instead of
   linking to libnuma (which appears to have caveats with -static).
 - Add KVM_SYSCALL_DEFINE() infrastructure to reduce the boilerplate needed
   to wrap syscalls and/or to assert that a syscall succeeds.
 - Rename kvm_gmem to gmem_file, and use gmem_inode for the inode structure.
 - Track flags in a gmem_inode field instead of using i_private.
 - Add comments to call out subtleties in the mempolicy code (e.g. that
   returning NULL for vm_operations_struct.get_policy() is important for ABI
   reasons).
 - Improve debugability of guest_memfd_test (I kept generating SIGBUS when
   tweaking the tests).
 - Test mbind() with private memory (sadly, verifying placement with
   move_pages() doesn't work due to the dependency on valid page tables).

- V11: Rebase on kvm-next, remove RFC tag, use Ackerley's latest patch
       and fix a rcu race bug during kvm module unload.
- V10: Rebase on top of Fuad's V17. Use latest guest_memfd inode patch
       from Ackerley (with David's review comments). Use newer kmem_cache_create()
       API variant with arg parameter (Vlastimil)
- v9: Rebase on top of Fuad's V13 and incorporate review comments
- v8: Rebase on top of Fuad's V12: Host mmaping for guest_memfd memory.
- v7: Use inodes to store NUMA policy instead of file [0].
- v4-v6: Current approach using shared_policy support and vm_ops (based on
         suggestions from David [1] and guest_memfd bi-weekly upstream
         call discussion [2]).
- v3: Introduced fbind() syscall for VMM memory-placement configuration.
- v1,v2: Extended the KVM_CREATE_GUEST_MEMFD IOCTL to pass mempolicy.

[PATCH v2 1/3] x86/bhi: Add BHB clearing for CPUs with larger branch
Author: Pawan Gupta <pawan.kumar.gupta@linux.intel.com>

Add a version of clear_bhb_loop() that works on CPUs with larger branch
history table such as Alder Lake and newer. This could serve as a cheaper
alternative to IBPB mitigation for VMSCAPE.

clear_bhb_loop() and the new clear_bhb_long_loop() only differ in the loop
counter. Convert the asm implementation of clear_bhb_loop() into a macro
that is used by both the variants, passing counter as an argument.

There is no difference in the output of:

  $ objdump --disassemble=clear_bhb_loop vmlinux

before and after this commit.

New:  VMSCAPE optimization for BHI variant
[PATCH v2 0/3] VMSCAPE optimization for BHI variant
Author: Pawan Gupta <pawan.kumar.gupta@linux.intel.com>

v2:
- Added check for IBPB feature in vmscape_select_mitigation(). (David)
- s/vmscape=auto/vmscape=on/ (David)
- Added patch to remove LFENCE from VMSCAPE BHB-clear sequence.
- Rebased to v6.18-rc1.

v1: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250924-vmscape-bhb-v1-0-da51f0e1934d@linux.intel.com

Hi All,

These patches aim to improve the performance of a recent mitigation for
VMSCAPE[1] vulnerability. This improvement is relevant for BHI variant of
VMSCAPE that affect Alder Lake and newer processors.

The current mitigation approach uses IBPB on kvm-exit-to-userspace for all
affected range of CPUs. This is an overkill for CPUs that are only affected
by the BHI variant. On such CPUs clearing the branch history is sufficient
for VMSCAPE, and also more apt as the underlying issue is due to poisoned
branch history.

Roadmap:

- First patch introduces clear_bhb_long_loop() for processors with larger
  branch history tables.
- Second patch replaces IBPB on exit-to-userspace with branch history
  clearing sequence.

Below is the iPerf data for transfer between guest and host, comparing IBPB
and BHB-clear mitigation. BHB-clear shows performance improvement over IBPB
in most cases.

Platform: Emerald Rapids
Baseline: vmscape=off

New:  RISC-V: KVM: Read HGEIP CSR on the correct cpu
[PATCH] RISC-V: KVM: Read HGEIP CSR on the correct cpu
Author: fangyu.yu <fangyu.yu@linux.alibaba.com>


When executing kvm_riscv_vcpu_aia_has_interrupts, the vCPU may have
migrated and the IMSIC VS-file have not been updated yet, currently
the HGEIP CSR should be read from the imsic->vsfile_cpu ( the pCPU
before migration ) via on_each_cpu_mask, but this will trigger an
IPI call and repeated IPI within a period of time is expensive in
a many-core systems.

Just let the vCPU execute and update the correct IMSIC VS-file via
kvm_riscv_vcpu_aia_imsic_update may be a simple solution.
