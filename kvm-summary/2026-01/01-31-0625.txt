New:  KVM: SVM: Add __read_mostly to frequently read module parameters
[PATCH] KVM: SVM: Add __read_mostly to frequently read module parameters
Author: lirongqing <lirongqing@baidu.com>


Mark static global variables that are primarily read-only with
__read_mostly to optimize cache utilization and performance.

The modified variables are module parameters and configuration
flags that are:
- Initialized at boot time
- Rarely modified during runtime
- Frequently accessed by multiple CPUs

By grouping these frequently read variables together, we reduce
cache line bouncing in SMP systems and improve overall performance
of the SVM module.

This series is based on latest VFIO fix, which will be sent to Linus
very soon.

Thanks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This series documents a dma-buf “revoke” mechanism: to allow a dma-buf
exporter to explicitly invalidate (“kill”) a shared buffer after it has
been distributed to importers, so that further CPU and device access is
prevented and importers reliably observe failure.

The change in this series is to properly document and use existing core
“revoked” state on the dma-buf object and a corresponding exporter-triggered
revoke operation.

dma-buf has quietly allowed calling move_notify on pinned dma-bufs, even
though legacy importers using dma_buf_attach() would simply ignore
these calls.

The intention was that move_notify() would tell the importer to expedite
it's unmapping process and once the importer is fully finished with DMA it
would unmap the dma-buf which finally signals that the importer is no
longer ever going to touch the memory again. Importers that touch past
their unmap() call can trigger IOMMU errors, AER and beyond, however
read-and-discard access between move_notify() and unmap is allowed.

Thus, we can define the exporter's revoke sequence for pinned dma-buf as:

	dma_resv_lock(dmabuf->resv, NULL);
	// Prevent new mappings from being established
	priv->revoked = true;

	// Tell all importers to eventually unmap
	dma_buf_invalidate_mappings(dmabuf);

	// Wait for any inprogress fences on the old mapping
	dma_resv_wait_timeout(dmabuf->resv,
			      DMA_RESV_USAGE_BOOKKEEP, false,
			      MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT);
	dma_resv_unlock(dmabuf->resv, NULL);

	// Wait for all importers to complete unmap
	wait_for_completion(&priv->unmapp_comp);

However, dma-buf also supports importers that don't do anything on
move_notify(), and will not unmap the buffer in bounded time.

Since such importers would cause the above sequence to hang, a new
mechanism is needed to detect incompatible importers.

Introduce dma_buf_attach_revocable() which if true indicates the above
sequence is safe to use and will complete in kernel-only bounded time for
this attachment.

Unfortunately dma_buf_attach_revocable() is going to fail for the popular
RDMA pinned importer, which means we cannot introduce it to existing
places using pinned move_notify() without potentially breaking existing
userspace flows.

Existing exporters that only trigger this flow for RAS errors should not
call dma_buf_attach_revocable() and will suffer an unbounded block on the
final completion, hoping that the userspace will notice the RAS and clean
things up. Without revoke support on the RDMA pinned importers it doesn't
seem like any other non-breaking option is currently possible.

For new exporters, like VFIO and RDMA, that have userspace triggered
revoke events, the unbouned sleep would not be acceptable. They can call
dma_buf_attach_revocable() and will not work with the RDMA pinned importer
from day 0, preventing regressions.

In the process add documentation explaining the above details.

New:  RISC-V: KVM: Fix null pointer dereference in kvm_riscv_vcpu_aia_rmw_topei()
[PATCH] RISC-V: KVM: Fix null pointer dereference in kvm_riscv_vcpu_aia_rmw_topei()
Author: Jiakai Xu <xujiakai2025@iscas.ac.cn>

kvm_riscv_vcpu_aia_rmw_topei() assumes that the per-vCPU IMSIC state has
been initialized once AIA is reported as available and initialized at
the VM level. This assumption does not always hold.

Under fuzzed ioctl sequences, a guest may access the IMSIC TOPEI CSR
before the vCPU IMSIC state is set up. In this case,
vcpu->arch.aia_context.imsic_state is still NULL, and the TOPEI RMW path
dereferences it unconditionally, leading to a host kernel crash.

The crash manifests as:
  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address
  dfffffff0000000e
  ...

  kvm_riscv_vcpu_exit arch/riscv/kvm/vcpu_exit.c:230
  kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run arch/riscv/kvm/vcpu.c:1008
  ...

Fix this by explicitly checking whether the vCPU IMSIC state has been
initialized before handling TOPEI CSR accesses. If not, forward the CSR
emulation to user space.

New:  RISC-V: KVM: Fix use-after-free in kvm_riscv_gstage_get_leaf()
[PATCH] RISC-V: KVM: Fix use-after-free in kvm_riscv_gstage_get_leaf()
Author: Jiakai Xu <xujiakai2025@iscas.ac.cn>

While fuzzing KVM on RISC-V, a use-after-free was observed in
kvm_riscv_gstage_get_leaf(),  where ptep_get() dereferences a
freed gstage page table page during gfn unmap.

The crash manifests as:

    kvm_flush_shadow_all virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:344 [inline]

The UAF is caused by gstage page table walks running concurrently with
gstage pgd teardown. In particular, kvm_unmap_gfn_range() can traverse
gstage page tables while kvm_arch_flush_shadow_all() frees the pgd,
leading to use-after-free of page table pages.

Fix the issue by serializing gstage unmap and pgd teardown with
kvm->mmu_lock. Holding mmu_lock ensures that gstage page tables
remain valid for the duration of unmap operations and prevents
concurrent frees.

This matches existing RISC-V KVM usage of mmu_lock to protect gstage
map/unmap operations, e.g. kvm_riscv_mmu_iounmap.

New:  igvm: Supply MADT via IGVM parameter
[PATCH v6 0/9] igvm: Supply MADT via IGVM parameter
Author: Oliver Steffen <osteffen@redhat.com>

When launching using an IGVM file, supply a copy of the MADT (part of the ACPI
tables) via an IGVM parameter (IGVM_VHY_MADT) to the guest, in addition to the
regular fw_cfg mechanism.

The IGVM parameter can be consumed by Coconut SVSM [1], instead of relying on
the fw_cfg interface, which has caused problems before due to unexpected access
[2,3]. Using IGVM parameters is the default way for Coconut SVSM; switching
over would allow removing specialized code paths for QEMU in Coconut.

Coconut SVSM needs to know the SMP configuration, but does not look at
any other ACPI data, nor does it interact with the PCI bus settings.
Since the MADT is static and not linked with other ACPI tables, it can
be supplied stand-alone like this.

Generating the MADT twice (IGVM processing and ACPI table building) seems
acceptable, since there is no infrastructure to obtain the MADT out of the ACPI
table memory area during IGVM processing.

In any case OVMF, which runs after SVSM has already been initialized, will
continue reading all ACPI tables via fw_cfg and provide fixed up ACPI data to
the OS as before.

This series makes ACPI table building more generic by making the BIOS linker
optional. This allows the MADT to be generated outside of the ACPI build
context. A new function (acpi_build_madt_standalone()) is added for that. With
that, the IGVM MADT parameter field can be filled with the MADT data during
processing of the IGVM file.

[2] https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/2882
[3] https://github.com/coconut-svsm/svsm/issues/646

v6:
- Fix errors on non-i386 architectures
  - Only build IGVM stubs file if feature is enabled.
  - Move IGVM-related struct definitions to an internal header
  - Move IGVM parameter handler for MADT to i386 code and stub it for other
    architectures
- Reuse existing ACPI checksum function instead of adding a new one

v5:
- Rebase on latest IGVM rework series from Gerd
- Make qigvm_find_parameter_entry() more generic and use everywhere possible;
  It now takes the index as input, instead of the full parameter struct
- Consistently use early returns when looking up parameter entries
- Emit a warning message if no parameter area can be found for a given index

v4:
- Add ACPI table checksum calculation without BIOS linker, used
  for the standalone MADT.
- Don't pass ConfidentialGuestState into the IGVM backend anymore.
  Not needed, since we already have the full MachineState there now.
- Move the NULL check patch out into a new series (to be posted).
- Address remaining cleanup comments.

v3:
- Pass the machine state into IGVM file processing context instead of MADT data
- Generate MADT from inside the IGVM backend
- Refactor: Extract common code for finding IGVM parameter from IGVM parameter
  handlers
- Add NULL pointer check for igvm_get_buffer()

v2:
- Provide more context in the message of the main commit
- Document the MADT parameter of IgvmCfgClass::process()
- Document why no MADT data is provided the process call in sev.c

New:  KVM: x86/pmu: Add support for AMD Host-Only/Guest-Only bits
[PATCH v2 0/5] KVM: x86/pmu: Add support for AMD Host-Only/Guest-Only bits
Author: Jim Mattson <jmattson@google.com>

This series adds support for AMD's Host-Only and Guest-Only performance
counter eventsel bits in KVM's mediated PMU passthrough implementation.

These bits allow an nSVM-enabled guest to configure performance counters
that count only during L1 execution (Host-Only) or only during L2 execution
(Guest-Only).

KVM updates the hardware event selector ENABLE bit at the following state
transitions to ensure counters only count in the appropriate mode:

  - EFER.SVME changes: Enable/disable Guest-Only counters
  - Nested VMRUN: Disable Host-Only, enable Guest-Only counters
  - Nested VMEXIT: Enable Host-Only, disable Guest-Only counters

v1: https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20260121225438.3908422-1-jmattson@google.com/

v1 -> v2:
  - Fixed various style issues, including indentation, comment
    placement, and comparison to 0 [Sean]
  - Replaced "hg_only" with "host_guest" [Sean]
  - Reversed the polarity of the dormant/active logic [Sean]
  - Removed the pmc_hostonly and pmc_guestonly bitmaps [Sean]
  - Added a refresh helper that iterates over PMCs during transitions [Sean]
  - Introduced svm_enter_guest_mode() and svm_leave_guest_mode() [Sean]
  - Moved transition logic from VMRUN/VMEXIT emulation to the above [Sean]
  - Moved architectural definitions in the selftest to pmu.h [Sean]
  - Added a test for neither Host-Only nor Guest-Only [Sean]
  - Refactored the selftest to program all 4 bit combinations
    simultaneously, reducing code replication [Sean]
